&lt;p&gt;I have to be honest; when I posted the first of these logs from my bedroom in North London, I didn’t think it would go very far. After all, why would it? I wasn’t a regular contributor to this site, nor a seasoned veteran of the paranormal. I was just a man who missed his friend, seeking a few words of wisdom from an online message board, open to the idea that it wouldn’t lead anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suffice to say I couldn’t have been more wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past two months, the incredible advice I’ve received from this forum, and the amazing leads you’ve sent my way, have opened up entire worlds of possibility. It’s thanks to all of you that I’m where I am now; sitting in a rental car on a quiet street in Phoenix, Arizona, posting the last of Alice’s records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realise I’ve written more than usual for my part. Apologies for this. If you want to skip straight to Alice’s section, that’s fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, please consider this the prologue to the epilogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s very, very early in the morning over here, with only the gravest of the graveyard shift out on the streets. By all rights I should be in bed, and not wasting petrol on an aimless drive through the city. The ritual helps me think however, and I’d recently been given a lot to think about, courtesy of a young woman at a local bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was a forum member, who’d contacted me over Direct Message. When we met up earlier in the night, it was clear she’d done a great deal of research; charting every mirror shop in Phoenix in an attempt to reconstruct the route Alice took on February 7th 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spoke for quite a while; about the game, about Alice, and about life in general. Once closing time rolled around, she handed me a printout of the most likely route, with all the key locations circled. Then, in the final minutes before we parted ways, she nervously asked me two questions. The first put me in a rather sour mood.  The second provided the fuel for my 3am drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Question One; Are you sure she wants you to find her?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been hearing the same query from a few of you recently, especially since Part 9 was posted. People commenting that Alice made a clear choice when she left Rob behind in the silent city. That I was searching for someone who wasn’t seeking return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to take a moment to respond to this, as I responded to it earlier tonight. To be clear, the Alice I know wouldn&amp;#39;t do that. She was planning to come back, she’d told us as much. I’m not going to waste your time with my theories, but we’ve seen what the road can do to people&amp;#39;s minds, how it can carry them away against their better judgement. I understand why it&amp;#39;s being asked but if those sorts of questions are all you have to offer, I’d kindly ask you find another way to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Question Two was less clear cut; what are you going to do now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s something you guys have also been asking me, but that was the first time I’d heard the question out loud. In the awkward silence that followed it became obvious to her, and in some ways to me, that I didn’t yet have an answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to take a drive while I figured it out… I’ve been in my car for the rest of the night,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an hour of aimless meandering, I realised I was close to one of the marked locations; the alleyway where Alice first entered the underpass, the point at which she first disappeared into the road. Turning into the side street, just after a large intersection, I was briefly relieved to see no sign of the tunnel. The part of me that still hoped this game was a fiction swelled at the sudden lack of evidence. My reaction was short lived of course, as I quickly realised that the tunnel wouldn&amp;#39;t have shown itself to me anyway. Even if the game were real, I’d hardly been sticking to the rules on my way here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no denying that the place resembled Alice’s descriptions however, and with a long time to go until I’d feel remotely tired, I decided to work my way back along the route, retracing Alice’s steps towards Rob Guthard’s street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK so I have to admit at this point, I suffered from a momentary lapse in intelligence. In a fog of distraction, residual jetlag and general dullardry, I drove for longer than I’d care to admit under the misconception that I &lt;em&gt;wasn’t&lt;/em&gt; playing the game. I thought this because I was heading in the opposite direction, and had started my run with a right hand turn, when the rules explicitly state that you begin by turning left. Of course, as I’m sure all of you would have realised immediately, that didn’t mean I was out of the game, it just meant I started playing with my first left turn, one road later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alice was always the smart one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I’m trying to say is that, due to this fairly mindless oversight, I wasn’t exactly looking out for the Woman in Grey as I drove past what should have been her corner. There wasn’t a mirror shop this time of course, that’s only the 34th turn when you’re coming the other way, in fact I’m not sure which of the many passing streets it was. It is strange though, as I think back through my journey, I feel like I would have noticed her. The streets were practically deserted, so much so that any pedestrians stood out immediately. I know I should’ve been looking more closely but, if you asked my honest opinion… I don&amp;#39;t think she was there at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moment I realised this, I felt it again; the faint perverse, hope that I’d been misled, that the entire story was nothing more than a twisted, elaborate fabrication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t long until I passed an old mirror shop and, 34 turns later, arrived on what must have been Alice’s starting street. It was an inner-city neighbourhood whose residents were all fast asleep. From the moment I realised that the game was in play, I’d been thinking less and less about this particular road, and more about the one directly after it, resting just beyond the crossroads. I’d come halfway across the world on the strength of Alice’s account, but I’d seen no first hand proof of the Left/Right Game. If the whole thing was a hoax, then the next road should just be another street. If it was real, then I’d know soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I crawled up to the junction with my heart in my throat. With every inch of road that passed under my tyres, I found myself hoping more and more that it wouldn’t be true. Let someone be playing a prank on me, let the logs be counterfeit... let Alice be anywhere else but on that road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took the corner in a wide arc, parking myself in the centre of the crossroads, my headlights facing down the next turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahead of me was a quiet residential street; lines of neatly parked cars, rows of well-kept yards and squarely drawn windows. Yet at its centre, in utter defiance of the modest surroundings, the road sank into a deep and dimly lit corridor, cutting beneath the street, and disappearing into complete darkness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d always known it was true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the presence of grim confirmation, the question I was asked earlier that night started to ring in my ears, as if echoing out of the tunnel itself. After an entire night’s driving, after two full months of searching, I still didn’t have a response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end I just left the engine running, as if turning it off would somehow be a sign of retreat, and decided to type up the notes you’re reading now. I thought maybe the process of putting it all down on paper would bring me clarity, and leave me with either a note of farewell or a note of apology to Alice, for not having what it took to find her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now… here I am; still undecided, still writing, still sitting in this rental car on a quiet street in Phoenix, Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though perhaps the street’s not as quiet as I thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve just looked back to the previous road, down the street where Alice began her journey. As I type this very paragraph, I can see a figure standing on the sidewalk, just outside one of the houses. It isn’t the woman in grey this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though it’s almost too dark to make out, I can tell the figure is an older male, well built and imposing, the rugged features of his weathered face half lit by moonlight. I’ve never seen this person before, yet he bears a striking resemblance to another man; a man whose description has been well recorded within the pages of Alice’s logs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He watches me in silence, staring through the window of my still running car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder if he can help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Left/Right Game [DRAFT 1] 20/02/2017&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Left/Right Game was once nothing more than a 9-page document, peeking out of a yellow envelope, resting quietly on my desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember reading it on my lunch break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember it made me laugh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The submission had arrived with the first post, quietly making its way around the office, treated by everyone as a short-lived novelty of little journalistic value. The story was easy to dismiss, appearing all too similar to the rambling ghost stories and blurry UFO sightings that filled our mailbox on a daily basis, and which most of the senior staff had learned to instinctively ignore. Doomed by association, the document was quickly passed over, my desk merely a pit stop on its way to the rejection pile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was curious however and, after an uneventful few months in my new role, I had no compunctions about fishing from the scrap heap. Placing the envelope in my satchel, alongside a misfit crowd of similar rejects, I slipped away to a local coffee shop, reading it in an armchair by the window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhere around page three, between the description of the game’s rules and the exhaustive list of “Required Skills”, my mouth started to curl into an irrepressible smile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’d been gloriously wrong about this one. It wasn’t some paranoid diatribe, nor a sensationalist plea for attention. Within those pages lay an introductory glimpse of a man’s passionate obsession. As I read on, something about his earnest eccentricity, incredible thoroughness, and unquestioning confidence made it impossible to put down. When I turned the final page, reading the last of Rob Guthard’s charming and refreshingly well formatted submission, I knew that this was the story I wanted to tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later that day, I found myself in the editor’s office making a case for it. They didn’t quite see what I saw, but I was intent to win them over regardless. I told them the story would be characterful, colourful, thought-provoking and, at the very least, that I wouldn’t be gone long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been twelve days since then; ten since I first entered the Wrangler in Phoenix, Arizona, five since I commandeered it myself, leaving Rob behind in the silent city. I haven’t updated much recently, save for a regular set of notes made for my own benefit. In all honesty, after I finished writing up my account of the city, I was struck by an overpowering sense of needlessness. There was no one left to receive these logs, no friends to proofread, no editor to hand them to. It seemed pointless to maintain the same prosaic format as before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still largely agree with this assessment. It’s only due to a set of exceptional circumstances that I’ve chosen to type up the following account in full.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoever this reaches, I want to thank you for reading up to now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m quite sure this will be my final instalment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moon has broken, and in my entire life, I’ve never witnessed an evening so still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The air is cool and quiet, and the Wrangler cuts cleanly through it as I glide down a stretch of even tarmac. The scene is defined by calm and absence. Not a cloud in the sky, not a solitary whisper of breeze, not a single blade of grass stirring on the dark green banks beside me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet even on a night as peaceful as this, I can’t help but feel far away from home. The city had served as a turning point in that regard. Before we reached those titanic monoliths, the landscapes we passed through generally resembled the world I once knew. A few obvious exceptions aside, there was nothing about the environments that looked truly divorced from reality. That’s all changed now. The aberrant aspects of this new world are unignorable, constantly hanging at the corner of my eye, passively injecting a sense of wonder and disconcertion into the otherwise silent night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days ago the moon started to crack like old porcelain. I hardly noticed at first, my eyes fixed on the road as it loomed above me, quietly splintering into three jagged pieces. As of tonight, the empty space between each fragment has significantly increased. If I focus on the sky for a little while, I can almost see them falling away from each other, charting infinite and lonesome trajectories through a barren cosmos, against a backdrop of foreign constellations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stars themselves fall further than they should. The night sky travels down past the horizon and continues below it, wrapping underneath the grassy bank. It’s as if the road, and the narrow plains on either side, are suspended in the middle of a vast abyss; a platform in the middle of open space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least that’s what I thought it was at first. It didn’t take long before I noticed the broken moon was appearing twice in the sky, both above and below me. A pair of orbiting satellites; identical and in perfect alignment. That’s when I realised that there were no stars below me. I was merely staring across a flat surface so flawlessly mirror-like as to cast a perfect reflection of the heavens above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was driving through the centre of a lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The water is impossibly still. Since leaving the shoreline proper yesterday night, I’ve seen neither a wave, nor a ripple across its placid surface. It’s also undeniably vast, reaching beyond the horizon in every direction and continuing further still. Without being sure how I know, I’m aware that the waters carry on for an unspeakable distance, that I would sooner reach the stars themselves before setting foot on its opposite shore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lean over and switch gears. The act of driving the Wrangler was a daunting one at first, but after the first two days I’ve managed to make do. An old scarf wrapped tightly around the steering wheel serves as a makeshift handle, allowing me to navigate corners one handed. I don’t have an elegant solution for the gearshift, but I’ve quickly grown used to the process. If I’ve learned anything from the road, it’s that grace is the first casualty in the fight for survival. Adaptability, no matter how clumsy, outlasts it at every turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later, the Wrangler pulls up to a spacious verge. A large circle of land surrounded entirely by dark waters. At the far end, the grass seems to fall away, dropping sharply into the lake with a dead stop. The road continues of course, but it&amp;#39;s the only thing that does. With nothing on either side, it forms a narrow bridge of perfectly flat asphalt, raised on a bed of mud and rock.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I press my boot onto the brake pedal, easing the Wrangler to a steady halt at the centre of the clearing. For the first time today, I open the car door and climb out of my seat. The dull tap of asphalt shifts to a soft rustling as I make my way over to the lakeside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s something on the shore, a barely discernible object, almost entirely concealed by a shock of verdant undergrowth. It’s a miracle I’d managed to spy it from the road, though perhaps something about the stark uniformity of the landscape had made it stand out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I advance towards the water, and the object draws near, its indeterminate form solidifies in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a human arm, reaching out from the water and onto the bank. I crouch down to examine the few pertinent details. The fingers are still embedded firmly into the soil. The thumbnail is broken, coloured by a peeling coat of faded varnish. There’s a pallid, emaciated quality to the skin, spreading down the arm until it disappears beneath a thick, woollen sleeve. At the point it meets the surface, the water soaks into the fabric, turning it black from the original grey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a sad exhalation, I rise to my feet and lean over the water’s edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The body of Marjorie Guthard lies against the silt, her cheek resting on the lake bed, her wide bewildered eyes staring out into the open lake. She’s been almost perfectly preserved. Save for the striking tautness of her skin and its mottled, grey pallor, she looks exactly like the woman I saw on the 34th turn, who’d tried to repel me from the road, who’d spoken of a lake drinking her wounds clean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems her ramblings weren’t completely void of fact. It’s clear to see that Marjorie has been exsanguinated, so completely in fact that the only evidence that blood ever flowed through her veins, is a large dark stain across her shredded blouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t take long before the perpetrator makes itself known.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stare into the water, a steady stream of formless whispers sink up through the depths of the lake. The softly spoken murmurings drift up to my ears, taking root in the back of my mind and instantly blooming into a flurry of deeply persuasive promises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find myself entirely transfixed by the still water, as a myriad of generous offerings unfold in throughout my consciousness. The whispers suggest an end to the phantom pains in my absent arm, perhaps even a completely restored limb, stronger than it had been before. Furthermore, it shows me a glimpse of its incomprehensible span, its furthest bank reaching across countless worlds, its deepest point lying below everything. I’m offered total knowledge of every league, every fathom, every inconceivable shore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hand reaches down as the whispers continue, every bargain steeped in sweet beneficence. A moment later, my outstretched fingers brush against the soft grass, and wrap around Marjorie’s exposed arm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digging my heels into the ground, I lean myself backwards and pull. The water ripples and splashes as I drag Marjorie’s lifeless body slowly onto the bank. I feel the voices in my mind grow louder, erupting in anger as I back away from the lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The promises had been convincing, each quiet solicitation undeniably persuasive. But after seeing Marjorie’s wretched fate and the look of eternal betrayal in her vacant eyes, I found myself aware of a subtle undercurrent behind every syllable, a sense of desperation and timeless hunger emanating from beneath the lake’s surface. I already have a clear understanding of what would have happened if I’d lost myself to those waters. I suspect it’s no coincidence, that of the countless shores it showed me, all of them appeared to be deserted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marjorie wouldn’t have stood a chance. She’d left the forest alone, grievously wounded and without a vehicle. She’d walked the whole way here, bleeding endlessly, the road’s rejuvenating power battling every moment against her body’s natural inclination to die. I suspect the road’s influence wasn’t strong enough, and when a whispering voice promised, ever so sweetly to mend her, she would have been in no position to refuse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her other sleeve brushes against dry land, her body leaving the water for the first time in decades. I keep pulling until my boots hit asphalt, laying her down on the grass just beside the Wrangler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a moment of sober vigil, I walk to the back of the car and fetch Rob’s foldable spade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A long few hours follow. I’ve never dug someone’s grave before, and my injury is hardly conducive to the task. My fleece tied around my waist, pearls of sweat running down my brow, I manage to slowly chip away at the damp earth. Five hours later, my back cramping, my hand raw from gripping the shovel, I attempt to lower Marjorie into the rough pit with some semblance of grace, her legs dropping limply into the soft soil despite my best efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes over an hour to shovel the soil back. It’s a sobering and ugly task. As a layer of dirt covers her face, I realise this will be the last time a living person lays their eyes on Marjorie Guthard. Burying her suddenly feels disrespectful, as if it’s an act I don’t have the right to perform. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once it’s done, I drop onto my knees, a dull ache in my muscles as I smooth out the disturbed ground with the back of the shovel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARJORIE:&lt;/strong&gt; You.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even before I turn to face her, I can hear a scowl in her voice. There’s an odious depth to that one acrid syllable, a potent witch’s brew of contempt and accusation that feels like it’s been festering in her drowned lungs for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reluctantly, I rise to my feet and turn around, finding myself face to face with the woman I just buried. She looks different now, her clothes are dry, her skin clear, with nothing to be seen of the deep, dark gash in her blouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AS:&lt;/strong&gt; Marjorie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the empty vessel below us, the woman in front of me is by no means at peace. She shakes and wretches with the same indignant fury I witnessed when we first met. When she speaks, her words shudder under the weight of her own turbulent emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARJORIE:&lt;/strong&gt;  I chased you. I ran to you. I… I gave him up for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AS:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m… I’m sorry Marjorie, I don’t know what you mean. Tell me what you mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARJOIRE&lt;/strong&gt; The things I saw, things so beautiful. And I saw her, walking alone through the new worlds. I gave everything up for you!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know quite what to say. It’s pointless to ask her what she means, to try and understand her frenetic ramblings. In the end, I can only try to speak her language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AS:&lt;/strong&gt; Marjorie I… I didn’t mean you to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marjorie’s trembling breaths burst into a despairing fit of laughter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARJORIE:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh… oh yes you did. Yes you did. And now… now you’re here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marjorie’s wild and volatile demeanour shifts once more, her laughter degrading further into a desperate crying panic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARJORIE:&lt;/strong&gt; And what do I do now? What- What do I do?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marjorie cringes with the terror of the self-imposed question, placing her head in her hands and repeating it over and over again. As I watch her wrestle with despair, I’m struck by an idea I’ve never before considered. The disconcerting notion that, in death, we are not transported to a set destination by some ethereal attendant. That in fact, nothing is decided for us. Perhaps the manner in which we spend our afterlife is down to us, a decision we have to make ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marjorie is standing over her own lifeless body, still lost, still entirely unmoored. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no sign of boundless paradise, inescapable damnation or everlasting nothingness, and the common thread they share, a final release from the weight of our own agency, is similarly absent. Perhaps we never get that freedom, perhaps we continue like we always do, accompanied by all our imperfections, uncertainty and discontent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps we must choose our eternity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all my time on the road, that’s possibly the most terrifying notion I’ve encountered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AS:&lt;/strong&gt; He never stopped looking you know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marjorie snaps out of her wretched despair, instantly aware of who I’m referring to, staring up at me with an expression I’ve never seen her wear before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AS:&lt;/strong&gt; I saw him, walking on the road. He didn’t stop. He was never going to stop. I think he was looking for you Marjorie, he still is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marjorie stares through me. For the first time since we met on that quiet Phoenician corner, I can see the faint spark of something other than misery and rage across her tear stained face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hold her gaze for a moment more, before pulling my phone from my pocket. In a single sweep of my contacts, I delete every number except for one. A number I pulled from the Nokia during our second night on the road. A number that connects to a lost wanderer of the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AS:&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t know if this can help but… stranger things have happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As she stares up into my eyes, I feel like we’re finally meeting for the first time. Without a word, Marjorie reaches out a quivering hand and takes the phone from my outstretched fingers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I can say anything more, Marjorie Guthard is gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few moments later, a refreshing breeze lands against my cheek, a soft zephyr, cooling my still warm face. It’s a welcome sensation, and the first movement I’ve witnessed in the air since I set out onto the lake. Wiping the sweat from my forehead, I stare quietly along the bridge, the breeze picking up around me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a subtle wind at first, brushing stray hairs across my forehead, chilling the perspiration on my neck. Yet as I reach my hand out, and feel the air slip between my fingers, I’m witness to a steady rise in both strength and magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sound of the wind grows from a whisper to a howl, Seconds later, the hanging sleeves of my fleece begin to stream sideways. My hair lifts from my back, billowing in the throes of a developing gale. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I back up against the Wrangler’s hood as the air finally erupts into a roaring, cacophonous cyclone. My hand reflexively seeks the sturdy frame of the Wrangler, my fingers wrapping around the grille, my arm tensing as the unrelenting wind threatens to drag me from the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Squinting through the violent tempest, I focus on a single point in space, just above the threshold of the bridge.  In the midst of the storm, a jagged line of white hot light bursts out of the ether, tearing through the night’s fabric, a crackling fissure that widens and yawns, forcing apart the curtains of reality as they frenetically struggle to recombine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Staring through the shuddering fracture, I’m subjected to the briefest glimpse of a boundless, and impossible vista. It is a faraway place in both distance and time. An achingly beautiful and gloriously terrifying dreamscape, enduring on the majestic shores of infinity. Every moment there spans a millennium and unfolds in countless directions at once. Every passing shadow holds a darkness beyond measure, their edges burned by the glare of a waking sun which looks across every conceivable world with a hollow, rancorous intent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the midst of this maddening landscape, a singular entity approaches, gliding towards the portal with the clear intent to pass through. As it breaches the shuddering gateway, and the wind dies down around it, I stare up at its grand celestial form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The being is unlike anything I’ve ever seen; composed entirely from electric arcs of brilliant, magnesic light which burst from a volatile and blinding central core. It sounds like a lightning storm, its plasmatic tendrils snapping and crackling, bursting chaotically through the night air before collapsing in on themselves. As they fall back into the creature’s centre, they emit pale clouds of vaporous fractals that fade softly into the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow, even as my eyes barely adjust to the stark light, I realise that the entity usually burns much brighter. It&amp;#39;s dampened its glow for my benefit, so that it can appear before me without scorching my eyes from their sockets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AS:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s you… isn’t it. You’re the voice I’ve been hearing. You’re the one who brought me here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bristling maelstrom of light hangs in the air, crackling and shifting, its transient limbs strobing with chaotic incandescence. Part of me wants to hide, part of me wants to run, but neither are an option anymore. Releasing my hand from the Wrangler’s grille I take a single step forward, standing on my own and staring up into the entity’s smouldering core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AS:&lt;/strong&gt; Can I get an interview?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creature doesn’t react. In the following silence, I feel it observing me. When it finally responds, its voice ruptures the night, echoing through my skull.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VOICE:&lt;/strong&gt; There is little time, but you may ask what questions you have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each reverberating syllable forms a string of literal shockwaves in the surrounding lake, emanating outwards from the being in a perfect circle. I watch the waves roll into the distance, showing no sign of ever diminishing, and I think about what question to ask first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, it comes to me quickly; a promise is a promise after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AS:&lt;/strong&gt; What happened to Marjorie? Why did she do what she did?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The being pauses, as if considering its response. When it does reply, it speaks with a calm sobriety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VOICE:&lt;/strong&gt; She glimpsed an echo of the future, dreamed of the road, of the things that it passes through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AS:&lt;/strong&gt; Like whatever’s through there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gesture through the gateway, which is now almost entirely blocked from view by the creature’s spiralling form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VOICE:&lt;/strong&gt; She dreamed of untold frontiers. She saw a lone woman walking them. Over time, the fulfilment of that vision became everything to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AS:&lt;/strong&gt; But it wasn’t her… she thought she was seeing her own future… but it was-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VOICE:&lt;/strong&gt; It was you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those three words, as they burst into the open air, casting three narrow waves across the boundless water, hit me with a deep and heavy force. Unbeknownst to myself, decades before I was even born, Marjorie had been driven insane by dreams of maddening grandeur, of a life of boundless possibility and true significance. She had given everything up to chase a shadow… a shadow that eventually turned out to be mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hadn’t just pulled Rob into this game, I was the reason for everything. I was the cause for the tragedy that befell his entire family, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AS:&lt;/strong&gt; She didn’t just dream those sights. You influenced her. You let her see them… the same way you made Rob see me in Aokigahara. You pushed and you prodded wherever you needed so that I’d end up here. Are you the reason Bobby got the rules in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VOICE:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AS:&lt;/strong&gt; But… why? You toyed with so many lives across… across decades. Why me? Why does it matter that I travel the road?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VOICE:&lt;/strong&gt; Because across all humanity, across every conceivable permutation, you are the one who makes it the furthest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It speaks plainly, as if the statement were a foregone conclusion. Yet its words strike me into silence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creature continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VOICE:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve watched you work your way here, through skill and through tenacity… and undeniably through luck. You were brought here because of these qualities, and they will carry you further along the road than any other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AS:&lt;/strong&gt; Then why didn’t you just bring me here? All that influence and you didn’t lift a finger… after everything that happened-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VOICE:&lt;/strong&gt; Events transpired as they needed to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AS:&lt;/strong&gt; As they… needed to?! People died! Marjorie. Bobby. Ace. Apollo. Eve. Lilith. Everyone. They’re all gone. Do you not care at all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to my words, the entity remains silent for longer than usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VOICE:&lt;/strong&gt; I care more than you know. There are things greater than your understanding, forces that exist beyond the realms of your comprehension that you would consider a threat to everything you hold dear. My actions were guided by a higher standard of knowledge. Your protests are predicated on false understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AS:&lt;/strong&gt; You’re saying I don’t understand death?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VOICE:&lt;/strong&gt; You don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AS:&lt;/strong&gt; ... That still doesn’t make it right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VOICE:&lt;/strong&gt; Regardless, my influence is necessary. That which is necessary must be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AS:&lt;/strong&gt; What even are you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VOICE::&lt;/strong&gt; I cannot answer that question in any way you’d understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AS:&lt;/strong&gt; That&amp;#39;s not good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creature doesn’t respond, as if it doesn’t feel it needs to. So far it’s returned my every argument with impenetrable certainty. From the domain it occupies, knowing what it knows, my arguments must seem entirely facile. Even if it did feel the need to justify itself, after seeing the place it hails from, I wonder if there’s any way I could ever comprehend its motives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, that doesn’t mean my arguments are invalid, and the creature’s lofty dispassion does little more than stoke my desire to oppose it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AS:&lt;/strong&gt; And what if I don’t want any part of this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VOICE:&lt;/strong&gt; You are travelling the aberrant strand; a singularly stable flaw in the fabric of reality. As it carries you further from the world you know, you will be freed from the influence of the old laws. You have already noticed the effects in those who settled the road, those who were lost to it and in yourself; energy without consumption, knowledge without requisite experience. You are shedding entropy, and causality and in time you will reach realms of understanding you cannot currently fathom. You will find answers to questions you never thought to ask. You will discover absolute truth. For this reason, you will carry on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AS:&lt;/strong&gt; That’s the only reason?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VOICE:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you need another?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t come across as a question, but rather another blunt statement of fact. I understand the effect it’s speaking of. Ever since the city, I’ve been encountering vague notions and fragmented ideas that occur to me randomly and without announcement. New avenues of thought leading to revelations that would otherwise lie beyond my mortal reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve started to comprehend things I could barely have conceived of back home, and though the onset of these notions had been terrifying at first, they grow less so with every passing day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AS:&lt;/strong&gt; No… no, I don’t trust you. I don’t-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VOICE:&lt;/strong&gt; Your trust is immaterial. You will travel the road regardless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creature’s already stark glow starts to intensify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VOICE:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve watched you, on every turn … across every moment of your journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the creature’s countless protrusions lashes out at the empty air, forming another harsh, glowing fissure. It wrenches itself open in a few stilted jolts, a transparent, almost crystalline membrane stretched across the gap. Through it, I can see myself, in the centre of a cornfield, examining a block of C4 explosive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s as if I’m staring into the past through a jagged shard of one-way glass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VOICE:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve watched you questioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though we can’t be seen through the aperture, I see the glasslike membrane shake with the force of the creature’s voice. As the window collapses, I can see the rows of corn thrown into a frenzy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second arc lashes out at the sky, forming a second aperture. This time I’m expecting the sight before me. I see myself, crying in the forest… a silent radio by my side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VOICE:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve watched you struggle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second window closes. The creature has made its point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VOICE:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve watched you fight… to make your way here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VOICE:&lt;/strong&gt; You will not turn around. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AS:&lt;/strong&gt; You make it sound like I don’t have a choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VOICE:&lt;/strong&gt; You do have a choice Alice, but you have already made it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as I’ve grown to detest the creature’s presumption, in that moment, I know it’s right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What it’s saying is true. I’ve done things I never would have imagined in order to get where I am now. In fact, if this being hadn’t arrived at all, I’d already be heading out over the bridge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not proud of what drives me; that same, ugly impulse that led me to refuse Rob’s offer of return, that made it so easy to leave him behind in the silent city. But there’s no denying the impulse is there. It’s been with me the whole time, long before I ever arrived in Phoenix, Arizona… and it’s buried deeper than I’ve ever wanted to admit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AS:&lt;/strong&gt; Can I… do I get to say goodbye?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entity says nothing. It hangs in the air, flickering and coursing with rupturing bolts of light. The next thing I hear is a faint mechanical hum emanating from the Wrangler behind me. Turning around, I pace briskly back to the car, opening the door and reaching into the passenger seat. My notebook is booting up, seemingly of its own accord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Picking up the laptop, I lift the lid as I march back towards the bridge. I stare up at the silent being before me. When I look down to the laptop, my email client is already displayed on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AS:&lt;/strong&gt; How… how long do I have?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VOICE:&lt;/strong&gt; Long enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entity begins to regress, its arcs diminishing as the being at its core turns away. Its message has been delivered. There is nothing more to discuss. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it passes through the gateway, into an unknowable world far removed from my own, I call out after it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AS:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m still not certain I trust you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The being focusses on me once more, as the fracture begins to close. A final set of waves pass across the surface of the lake as it solemnly replies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VOICE:&lt;/strong&gt; … I remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A moment later, the being is gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stand motionless in the middle of the road, the entity’s final remarks washing over me, its curious choice of words echoing in my head. In the renewed silence, the faint stirrings of an overwhelming and terrible revelation start to form in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could have simply said that it knew of my mistrust, that it heard the overtones in my voice, saw the disdain across my face or otherwise sensed it in the space between us. Instead, the being spoke as if my current feelings were a memory, dwelling somewhere within its depths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was undeniable that my time on the road was changing me, but in all this time I’d never truly considered how those changes might evolve as my journey continues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d never thought about what I might gain, what I might lose… or about what I might inevitably become.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short while passes before I lower my eyes from the empty space above the bridge, to the screen of my notebook. Lowering myself down, I cross my legs and rest my back against the Wrangler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been reading from the beginning, you’ve finally caught up with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you’ll allow me a few personal messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To Rob. I hope you’re able to read this someday, and I am so, so sorry for everything I’ve done; for everything I may do. I hope you understand that I didn’t know, and that none of this was your fault. You did the best you could, and the days I spent with you were the most significant of my life. It was an honour to know you and I hope that, among these pages, you find the answers, and the peace, that you deserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my mum and dad, I’m sorry I won’t be sending this to you. In the end, I was carried along this road by a profound selfishness, and I just can’t bring myself to face you. I can’t imagine the pain I’ll be putting you through, and I won&amp;#39;t try to justify my actions. All I can say is that I love you and I’m sorry that my last act towards you was one of cowardice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally to you; the person to whom this message will be addressed. I’m sorry. I always thought I’d see you again someday, that the roads I took would eventually lead me home. That doesn’t look so likely now. Though I could say a lot to you, I’m not going to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I wish we could have been friends for longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels like a lifetime since I first arrived at Rob Guthard’s quiet street. I remember the uncertainty as I waited for him to open his door, with no concievable idea what was about to transpire. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like so many other things, that’s now changed. Despite being in an entirely new world, further from home than anyone’s ever been, I know exactly what’s going to happen next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to take a drive. Take a left, then the next possible road on the right, then the next possible left. I will repeat the process ad infinitum, until I wind up somewhere new. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And from there I’ll keep driving, beyond worlds, beyond time, beyond the bounds of my imagining. To a place where the lake runs dry, where the broken moon drifts away, and the stars disappear in the rear view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To a place where everything has fallen away, and the road is all there is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;
                    [selftext] => Well then… here we are.

I have to be honest; when I posted the first of these logs from my bedroom in North London, I didn’t think it would go very far. After all, why would it? I wasn’t a regular contributor to this site, nor a seasoned veteran of the paranormal. I was just a man who missed his friend, seeking a few words of wisdom from an online message board, open to the idea that it wouldn’t lead anywhere.
 
Suffice to say I couldn’t have been more wrong.

Over the past two months, the incredible advice I’ve received from this forum, and the amazing leads you’ve sent my way, have opened up entire worlds of possibility. It’s thanks to all of you that I’m where I am now; sitting in a rental car on a quiet street in Phoenix, Arizona, posting the last of Alice’s records.
 
I realise I’ve written more than usual for my part. Apologies for this. If you want to skip straight to Alice’s section, that’s fine.
 
Otherwise, please consider this the prologue to the epilogue.
 
It’s very, very early in the morning over here, with only the gravest of the graveyard shift out on the streets. By all rights I should be in bed, and not wasting petrol on an aimless drive through the city. The ritual helps me think however, and I’d recently been given a lot to think about, courtesy of a young woman at a local bar.
 
She was a forum member, who’d contacted me over Direct Message. When we met up earlier in the night, it was clear she’d done a great deal of research; charting every mirror shop in Phoenix in an attempt to reconstruct the route Alice took on February 7th 2017.
 
We spoke for quite a while; about the game, about Alice, and about life in general. Once closing time rolled around, she handed me a printout of the most likely route, with all the key locations circled. Then, in the final minutes before we parted ways, she nervously asked me two questions. The first put me in a rather sour mood.  The second provided the fuel for my 3am drive.
 
Question One; Are you sure she wants you to find her?
 
I’ve been hearing the same query from a few of you recently, especially since Part 9 was posted. People commenting that Alice made a clear choice when she left Rob behind in the silent city. That I was searching for someone who wasn’t seeking return.
 
I’d like to take a moment to respond to this, as I responded to it earlier tonight. To be clear, the Alice I know wouldn't do that. She was planning to come back, she’d told us as much. I’m not going to waste your time with my theories, but we’ve seen what the road can do to people's minds, how it can carry them away against their better judgement. I understand why it's being asked but if those sorts of questions are all you have to offer, I’d kindly ask you find another way to help.
 
Question Two was less clear cut; what are you going to do now?
 
It’s something you guys have also been asking me, but that was the first time I’d heard the question out loud. In the awkward silence that followed it became obvious to her, and in some ways to me, that I didn’t yet have an answer.
 
I decided to take a drive while I figured it out… I’ve been in my car for the rest of the night,
 
After an hour of aimless meandering, I realised I was close to one of the marked locations; the alleyway where Alice first entered the underpass, the point at which she first disappeared into the road. Turning into the side street, just after a large intersection, I was briefly relieved to see no sign of the tunnel. The part of me that still hoped this game was a fiction swelled at the sudden lack of evidence. My reaction was short lived of course, as I quickly realised that the tunnel wouldn't have shown itself to me anyway. Even if the game were real, I’d hardly been sticking to the rules on my way here.
 
There was no denying that the place resembled Alice’s descriptions however, and with a long time to go until I’d feel remotely tired, I decided to work my way back along the route, retracing Alice’s steps towards Rob Guthard’s street.
 
OK so I have to admit at this point, I suffered from a momentary lapse in intelligence. In a fog of distraction, residual jetlag and general dullardry, I drove for longer than I’d care to admit under the misconception that I *wasn’t* playing the game. I thought this because I was heading in the opposite direction, and had started my run with a right hand turn, when the rules explicitly state that you begin by turning left. Of course, as I’m sure all of you would have realised immediately, that didn’t mean I was out of the game, it just meant I started playing with my first left turn, one road later.
 
Alice was always the smart one.
 
What I’m trying to say is that, due to this fairly mindless oversight, I wasn’t exactly looking out for the Woman in Grey as I drove past what should have been her corner. There wasn’t a mirror shop this time of course, that’s only the 34th turn when you’re coming the other way, in fact I’m not sure which of the many passing streets it was. It is strange though, as I think back through my journey, I feel like I would have noticed her. The streets were practically deserted, so much so that any pedestrians stood out immediately. I know I should’ve been looking more closely but, if you asked my honest opinion… I don't think she was there at all.
 
The moment I realised this, I felt it again; the faint perverse, hope that I’d been misled, that the entire story was nothing more than a twisted, elaborate fabrication.
 
It wasn’t long until I passed an old mirror shop and, 34 turns later, arrived on what must have been Alice’s starting street. It was an inner-city neighbourhood whose residents were all fast asleep. From the moment I realised that the game was in play, I’d been thinking less and less about this particular road, and more about the one directly after it, resting just beyond the crossroads. I’d come halfway across the world on the strength of Alice’s account, but I’d seen no first hand proof of the Left/Right Game. If the whole thing was a hoax, then the next road should just be another street. If it was real, then I’d know soon enough.
 
I crawled up to the junction with my heart in my throat. With every inch of road that passed under my tyres, I found myself hoping more and more that it wouldn’t be true. Let someone be playing a prank on me, let the logs be counterfeit... let Alice be anywhere else but on that road.
 
I took the corner in a wide arc, parking myself in the centre of the crossroads, my headlights facing down the next turn.
 
Ahead of me was a quiet residential street; lines of neatly parked cars, rows of well-kept yards and squarely drawn windows. Yet at its centre, in utter defiance of the modest surroundings, the road sank into a deep and dimly lit corridor, cutting beneath the street, and disappearing into complete darkness.
 
I’d always known it was true.
 
In the presence of grim confirmation, the question I was asked earlier that night started to ring in my ears, as if echoing out of the tunnel itself. After an entire night’s driving, after two full months of searching, I still didn’t have a response.
 
In the end I just left the engine running, as if turning it off would somehow be a sign of retreat, and decided to type up the notes you’re reading now. I thought maybe the process of putting it all down on paper would bring me clarity, and leave me with either a note of farewell or a note of apology to Alice, for not having what it took to find her.
 
And now… here I am; still undecided, still writing, still sitting in this rental car on a quiet street in Phoenix, Arizona.
 
Though perhaps the street’s not as quiet as I thought.
 
I’ve just looked back to the previous road, down the street where Alice began her journey. As I type this very paragraph, I can see a figure standing on the sidewalk, just outside one of the houses. It isn’t the woman in grey this time.
 
Though it’s almost too dark to make out, I can tell the figure is an older male, well built and imposing, the rugged features of his weathered face half lit by moonlight. I’ve never seen this person before, yet he bears a striking resemblance to another man; a man whose description has been well recorded within the pages of Alice’s logs.

He watches me in silence, staring through the window of my still running car.

I wonder if he can help.

The Left/Right Game [DRAFT 1] 20/02/2017
 
The Left/Right Game was once nothing more than a 9-page document, peeking out of a yellow envelope, resting quietly on my desk.
 
I remember reading it on my lunch break.
 
I remember it made me laugh.
 
The submission had arrived with the first post, quietly making its way around the office, treated by everyone as a short-lived novelty of little journalistic value. The story was easy to dismiss, appearing all too similar to the rambling ghost stories and blurry UFO sightings that filled our mailbox on a daily basis, and which most of the senior staff had learned to instinctively ignore. Doomed by association, the document was quickly passed over, my desk merely a pit stop on its way to the rejection pile.
 
I was curious however and, after an uneventful few months in my new role, I had no compunctions about fishing from the scrap heap. Placing the envelope in my satchel, alongside a misfit crowd of similar rejects, I slipped away to a local coffee shop, reading it in an armchair by the window.
 
Somewhere around page three, between the description of the game’s rules and the exhaustive list of “Required Skills”, my mouth started to curl into an irrepressible smile.
 
They’d been gloriously wrong about this one. It wasn’t some paranoid diatribe, nor a sensationalist plea for attention. Within those pages lay an introductory glimpse of a man’s passionate obsession. As I read on, something about his earnest eccentricity, incredible thoroughness, and unquestioning confidence made it impossible to put down. When I turned the final page, reading the last of Rob Guthard’s charming and refreshingly well formatted submission, I knew that this was the story I wanted to tell.
 
Later that day, I found myself in the editor’s office making a case for it. They didn’t quite see what I saw, but I was intent to win them over regardless. I told them the story would be characterful, colourful, thought-provoking and, at the very least, that I wouldn’t be gone long.
 
It’s been twelve days since then; ten since I first entered the Wrangler in Phoenix, Arizona, five since I commandeered it myself, leaving Rob behind in the silent city. I haven’t updated much recently, save for a regular set of notes made for my own benefit. In all honesty, after I finished writing up my account of the city, I was struck by an overpowering sense of needlessness. There was no one left to receive these logs, no friends to proofread, no editor to hand them to. It seemed pointless to maintain the same prosaic format as before.
 
I still largely agree with this assessment. It’s only due to a set of exceptional circumstances that I’ve chosen to type up the following account in full.
 
Whoever this reaches, I want to thank you for reading up to now.
 
I’m quite sure this will be my final instalment.
 
*****
 
The moon has broken, and in my entire life, I’ve never witnessed an evening so still.
 
The air is cool and quiet, and the Wrangler cuts cleanly through it as I glide down a stretch of even tarmac. The scene is defined by calm and absence. Not a cloud in the sky, not a solitary whisper of breeze, not a single blade of grass stirring on the dark green banks beside me.
 
Yet even on a night as peaceful as this, I can’t help but feel far away from home. The city had served as a turning point in that regard. Before we reached those titanic monoliths, the landscapes we passed through generally resembled the world I once knew. A few obvious exceptions aside, there was nothing about the environments that looked truly divorced from reality. That’s all changed now. The aberrant aspects of this new world are unignorable, constantly hanging at the corner of my eye, passively injecting a sense of wonder and disconcertion into the otherwise silent night.
 
A few days ago the moon started to crack like old porcelain. I hardly noticed at first, my eyes fixed on the road as it loomed above me, quietly splintering into three jagged pieces. As of tonight, the empty space between each fragment has significantly increased. If I focus on the sky for a little while, I can almost see them falling away from each other, charting infinite and lonesome trajectories through a barren cosmos, against a backdrop of foreign constellations.
 
The stars themselves fall further than they should. The night sky travels down past the horizon and continues below it, wrapping underneath the grassy bank. It’s as if the road, and the narrow plains on either side, are suspended in the middle of a vast abyss; a platform in the middle of open space.
 
At least that’s what I thought it was at first. It didn’t take long before I noticed the broken moon was appearing twice in the sky, both above and below me. A pair of orbiting satellites; identical and in perfect alignment. That’s when I realised that there were no stars below me. I was merely staring across a flat surface so flawlessly mirror-like as to cast a perfect reflection of the heavens above.
 
I was driving through the centre of a lake.
 
The water is impossibly still. Since leaving the shoreline proper yesterday night, I’ve seen neither a wave, nor a ripple across its placid surface. It’s also undeniably vast, reaching beyond the horizon in every direction and continuing further still. Without being sure how I know, I’m aware that the waters carry on for an unspeakable distance, that I would sooner reach the stars themselves before setting foot on its opposite shore.
 
I lean over and switch gears. The act of driving the Wrangler was a daunting one at first, but after the first two days I’ve managed to make do. An old scarf wrapped tightly around the steering wheel serves as a makeshift handle, allowing me to navigate corners one handed. I don’t have an elegant solution for the gearshift, but I’ve quickly grown used to the process. If I’ve learned anything from the road, it’s that grace is the first casualty in the fight for survival. Adaptability, no matter how clumsy, outlasts it at every turn.
 
A few minutes later, the Wrangler pulls up to a spacious verge. A large circle of land surrounded entirely by dark waters. At the far end, the grass seems to fall away, dropping sharply into the lake with a dead stop. The road continues of course, but it's the only thing that does. With nothing on either side, it forms a narrow bridge of perfectly flat asphalt, raised on a bed of mud and rock.  
 
I press my boot onto the brake pedal, easing the Wrangler to a steady halt at the centre of the clearing. For the first time today, I open the car door and climb out of my seat. The dull tap of asphalt shifts to a soft rustling as I make my way over to the lakeside.
 
There’s something on the shore, a barely discernible object, almost entirely concealed by a shock of verdant undergrowth. It’s a miracle I’d managed to spy it from the road, though perhaps something about the stark uniformity of the landscape had made it stand out. 

As I advance towards the water, and the object draws near, its indeterminate form solidifies in my mind.
 
It’s a human arm, reaching out from the water and onto the bank. I crouch down to examine the few pertinent details. The fingers are still embedded firmly into the soil. The thumbnail is broken, coloured by a peeling coat of faded varnish. There’s a pallid, emaciated quality to the skin, spreading down the arm until it disappears beneath a thick, woollen sleeve. At the point it meets the surface, the water soaks into the fabric, turning it black from the original grey.
 
With a sad exhalation, I rise to my feet and lean over the water’s edge.
 
The body of Marjorie Guthard lies against the silt, her cheek resting on the lake bed, her wide bewildered eyes staring out into the open lake. She’s been almost perfectly preserved. Save for the striking tautness of her skin and its mottled, grey pallor, she looks exactly like the woman I saw on the 34th turn, who’d tried to repel me from the road, who’d spoken of a lake drinking her wounds clean.
 
It seems her ramblings weren’t completely void of fact. It’s clear to see that Marjorie has been exsanguinated, so completely in fact that the only evidence that blood ever flowed through her veins, is a large dark stain across her shredded blouse.

It doesn’t take long before the perpetrator makes itself known.
 
As I stare into the water, a steady stream of formless whispers sink up through the depths of the lake. The softly spoken murmurings drift up to my ears, taking root in the back of my mind and instantly blooming into a flurry of deeply persuasive promises.
 
I find myself entirely transfixed by the still water, as a myriad of generous offerings unfold in throughout my consciousness. The whispers suggest an end to the phantom pains in my absent arm, perhaps even a completely restored limb, stronger than it had been before. Furthermore, it shows me a glimpse of its incomprehensible span, its furthest bank reaching across countless worlds, its deepest point lying below everything. I’m offered total knowledge of every league, every fathom, every inconceivable shore.
 
My hand reaches down as the whispers continue, every bargain steeped in sweet beneficence. A moment later, my outstretched fingers brush against the soft grass, and wrap around Marjorie’s exposed arm.
 
Digging my heels into the ground, I lean myself backwards and pull. The water ripples and splashes as I drag Marjorie’s lifeless body slowly onto the bank. I feel the voices in my mind grow louder, erupting in anger as I back away from the lake.
 
The promises had been convincing, each quiet solicitation undeniably persuasive. But after seeing Marjorie’s wretched fate and the look of eternal betrayal in her vacant eyes, I found myself aware of a subtle undercurrent behind every syllable, a sense of desperation and timeless hunger emanating from beneath the lake’s surface. I already have a clear understanding of what would have happened if I’d lost myself to those waters. I suspect it’s no coincidence, that of the countless shores it showed me, all of them appeared to be deserted.

Marjorie wouldn’t have stood a chance. She’d left the forest alone, grievously wounded and without a vehicle. She’d walked the whole way here, bleeding endlessly, the road’s rejuvenating power battling every moment against her body’s natural inclination to die. I suspect the road’s influence wasn’t strong enough, and when a whispering voice promised, ever so sweetly to mend her, she would have been in no position to refuse. 
 
Her other sleeve brushes against dry land, her body leaving the water for the first time in decades. I keep pulling until my boots hit asphalt, laying her down on the grass just beside the Wrangler.

After a moment of sober vigil, I walk to the back of the car and fetch Rob’s foldable spade.
 
A long few hours follow. I’ve never dug someone’s grave before, and my injury is hardly conducive to the task. My fleece tied around my waist, pearls of sweat running down my brow, I manage to slowly chip away at the damp earth. Five hours later, my back cramping, my hand raw from gripping the shovel, I attempt to lower Marjorie into the rough pit with some semblance of grace, her legs dropping limply into the soft soil despite my best efforts.

It takes over an hour to shovel the soil back. It’s a sobering and ugly task. As a layer of dirt covers her face, I realise this will be the last time a living person lays their eyes on Marjorie Guthard. Burying her suddenly feels disrespectful, as if it’s an act I don’t have the right to perform. 

Once it’s done, I drop onto my knees, a dull ache in my muscles as I smooth out the disturbed ground with the back of the shovel.

**MARJORIE:** You.

Even before I turn to face her, I can hear a scowl in her voice. There’s an odious depth to that one acrid syllable, a potent witch’s brew of contempt and accusation that feels like it’s been festering in her drowned lungs for decades.

Reluctantly, I rise to my feet and turn around, finding myself face to face with the woman I just buried. She looks different now, her clothes are dry, her skin clear, with nothing to be seen of the deep, dark gash in her blouse.

**AS:** Marjorie.

Unlike the empty vessel below us, the woman in front of me is by no means at peace. She shakes and wretches with the same indignant fury I witnessed when we first met. When she speaks, her words shudder under the weight of her own turbulent emotions.

**MARJORIE:**  I chased you. I ran to you. I… I gave him up for you.

**AS:** I’m… I’m sorry Marjorie, I don’t know what you mean. Tell me what you mean.

**MARJOIRE** The things I saw, things so beautiful. And I saw her, walking alone through the new worlds. I gave everything up for you!!

I don’t know quite what to say. It’s pointless to ask her what she means, to try and understand her frenetic ramblings. In the end, I can only try to speak her language.

**AS:** Marjorie I… I didn’t mean you to.

Marjorie’s trembling breaths burst into a despairing fit of laughter.

**MARJORIE:** Oh… oh yes you did. Yes you did. And now… now you’re here.

Marjorie’s wild and volatile demeanour shifts once more, her laughter degrading further into a desperate crying panic.

**MARJORIE:** And what do I do now? What- What do I do?!

Marjorie cringes with the terror of the self-imposed question, placing her head in her hands and repeating it over and over again. As I watch her wrestle with despair, I’m struck by an idea I’ve never before considered. The disconcerting notion that, in death, we are not transported to a set destination by some ethereal attendant. That in fact, nothing is decided for us. Perhaps the manner in which we spend our afterlife is down to us, a decision we have to make ourselves.

Marjorie is standing over her own lifeless body, still lost, still entirely unmoored. 

There's no sign of boundless paradise, inescapable damnation or everlasting nothingness, and the common thread they share, a final release from the weight of our own agency, is similarly absent. Perhaps we never get that freedom, perhaps we continue like we always do, accompanied by all our imperfections, uncertainty and discontent. 

Perhaps we must choose our eternity.

After all my time on the road, that’s possibly the most terrifying notion I’ve encountered. 

**AS:** He never stopped looking you know.

Marjorie snaps out of her wretched despair, instantly aware of who I’m referring to, staring up at me with an expression I’ve never seen her wear before. 

**AS:** I saw him, walking on the road. He didn’t stop. He was never going to stop. I think he was looking for you Marjorie, he still is. 

Marjorie stares through me. For the first time since we met on that quiet Phoenician corner, I can see the faint spark of something other than misery and rage across her tear stained face.

I hold her gaze for a moment more, before pulling my phone from my pocket. In a single sweep of my contacts, I delete every number except for one. A number I pulled from the Nokia during our second night on the road. A number that connects to a lost wanderer of the road.

**AS:** I don’t know if this can help but… stranger things have happened.

As she stares up into my eyes, I feel like we’re finally meeting for the first time. Without a word, Marjorie reaches out a quivering hand and takes the phone from my outstretched fingers. 

Before I can say anything more, Marjorie Guthard is gone.

A few moments later, a refreshing breeze lands against my cheek, a soft zephyr, cooling my still warm face. It’s a welcome sensation, and the first movement I’ve witnessed in the air since I set out onto the lake. Wiping the sweat from my forehead, I stare quietly along the bridge, the breeze picking up around me.

It’s a subtle wind at first, brushing stray hairs across my forehead, chilling the perspiration on my neck. Yet as I reach my hand out, and feel the air slip between my fingers, I’m witness to a steady rise in both strength and magnitude.

The sound of the wind grows from a whisper to a howl, Seconds later, the hanging sleeves of my fleece begin to stream sideways. My hair lifts from my back, billowing in the throes of a developing gale. 

I back up against the Wrangler’s hood as the air finally erupts into a roaring, cacophonous cyclone. My hand reflexively seeks the sturdy frame of the Wrangler, my fingers wrapping around the grille, my arm tensing as the unrelenting wind threatens to drag me from the road.

Squinting through the violent tempest, I focus on a single point in space, just above the threshold of the bridge.  In the midst of the storm, a jagged line of white hot light bursts out of the ether, tearing through the night’s fabric, a crackling fissure that widens and yawns, forcing apart the curtains of reality as they frenetically struggle to recombine. 

Staring through the shuddering fracture, I’m subjected to the briefest glimpse of a boundless, and impossible vista. It is a faraway place in both distance and time. An achingly beautiful and gloriously terrifying dreamscape, enduring on the majestic shores of infinity. Every moment there spans a millennium and unfolds in countless directions at once. Every passing shadow holds a darkness beyond measure, their edges burned by the glare of a waking sun which looks across every conceivable world with a hollow, rancorous intent.

In the midst of this maddening landscape, a singular entity approaches, gliding towards the portal with the clear intent to pass through. As it breaches the shuddering gateway, and the wind dies down around it, I stare up at its grand celestial form.

The being is unlike anything I’ve ever seen; composed entirely from electric arcs of brilliant, magnesic light which burst from a volatile and blinding central core. It sounds like a lightning storm, its plasmatic tendrils snapping and crackling, bursting chaotically through the night air before collapsing in on themselves. As they fall back into the creature’s centre, they emit pale clouds of vaporous fractals that fade softly into the air.
 
Somehow, even as my eyes barely adjust to the stark light, I realise that the entity usually burns much brighter. It's dampened its glow for my benefit, so that it can appear before me without scorching my eyes from their sockets.

**AS:** It’s you… isn’t it. You’re the voice I’ve been hearing. You’re the one who brought me here.
 
The bristling maelstrom of light hangs in the air, crackling and shifting, its transient limbs strobing with chaotic incandescence. Part of me wants to hide, part of me wants to run, but neither are an option anymore. Releasing my hand from the Wrangler’s grille I take a single step forward, standing on my own and staring up into the entity’s smouldering core.

**AS:** Can I get an interview?

The creature doesn’t react. In the following silence, I feel it observing me. When it finally responds, its voice ruptures the night, echoing through my skull.

**VOICE:** There is little time, but you may ask what questions you have.

Each reverberating syllable forms a string of literal shockwaves in the surrounding lake, emanating outwards from the being in a perfect circle. I watch the waves roll into the distance, showing no sign of ever diminishing, and I think about what question to ask first.

In the end, it comes to me quickly; a promise is a promise after all.

**AS:** What happened to Marjorie? Why did she do what she did?

The being pauses, as if considering its response. When it does reply, it speaks with a calm sobriety.

**VOICE:** She glimpsed an echo of the future, dreamed of the road, of the things that it passes through.

**AS:** Like whatever’s through there?

I gesture through the gateway, which is now almost entirely blocked from view by the creature’s spiralling form.

**VOICE:** She dreamed of untold frontiers. She saw a lone woman walking them. Over time, the fulfilment of that vision became everything to her.
 
**AS:** But it wasn’t her… she thought she was seeing her own future… but it was-
 
**VOICE:** It was you.

Those three words, as they burst into the open air, casting three narrow waves across the boundless water, hit me with a deep and heavy force. Unbeknownst to myself, decades before I was even born, Marjorie had been driven insane by dreams of maddening grandeur, of a life of boundless possibility and true significance. She had given everything up to chase a shadow… a shadow that eventually turned out to be mine.

I hadn’t just pulled Rob into this game, I was the reason for everything. I was the cause for the tragedy that befell his entire family, 
 
**AS:** She didn’t just dream those sights. You influenced her. You let her see them… the same way you made Rob see me in Aokigahara. You pushed and you prodded wherever you needed so that I’d end up here. Are you the reason Bobby got the rules in the first place?
 
**VOICE:** Yes.
 
**AS:** But… why? You toyed with so many lives across… across decades. Why me? Why does it matter that I travel the road?
 
**VOICE:** Because across all humanity, across every conceivable permutation, you are the one who makes it the furthest.
 
It speaks plainly, as if the statement were a foregone conclusion. Yet its words strike me into silence.

The creature continues.

**VOICE:** I’ve watched you work your way here, through skill and through tenacity… and undeniably through luck. You were brought here because of these qualities, and they will carry you further along the road than any other.
 
**AS:** Then why didn’t you just bring me here? All that influence and you didn’t lift a finger… after everything that happened-
 
**VOICE:** Events transpired as they needed to.
 
**AS:** As they… needed to?! People died! Marjorie. Bobby. Ace. Apollo. Eve. Lilith. Everyone. They’re all gone. Do you not care at all?

In response to my words, the entity remains silent for longer than usual.
 
**VOICE:** I care more than you know. There are things greater than your understanding, forces that exist beyond the realms of your comprehension that you would consider a threat to everything you hold dear. My actions were guided by a higher standard of knowledge. Your protests are predicated on false understanding.
 
**AS:** You’re saying I don’t understand death?
 
**VOICE:** You don’t.
 
**AS:** ... That still doesn’t make it right.
 
**VOICE:** Regardless, my influence is necessary. That which is necessary must be.

**AS:** What even are you?
 
**VOICE::** I cannot answer that question in any way you’d understand.
 
**AS:** That's not good enough.

The creature doesn’t respond, as if it doesn’t feel it needs to. So far it’s returned my every argument with impenetrable certainty. From the domain it occupies, knowing what it knows, my arguments must seem entirely facile. Even if it did feel the need to justify itself, after seeing the place it hails from, I wonder if there’s any way I could ever comprehend its motives.

Still, that doesn’t mean my arguments are invalid, and the creature’s lofty dispassion does little more than stoke my desire to oppose it.

**AS:** And what if I don’t want any part of this?

**VOICE:** You are travelling the aberrant strand; a singularly stable flaw in the fabric of reality. As it carries you further from the world you know, you will be freed from the influence of the old laws. You have already noticed the effects in those who settled the road, those who were lost to it and in yourself; energy without consumption, knowledge without requisite experience. You are shedding entropy, and causality and in time you will reach realms of understanding you cannot currently fathom. You will find answers to questions you never thought to ask. You will discover absolute truth. For this reason, you will carry on.

**AS:** That’s the only reason?

**VOICE:** Do you need another?

It doesn’t come across as a question, but rather another blunt statement of fact. I understand the effect it’s speaking of. Ever since the city, I’ve been encountering vague notions and fragmented ideas that occur to me randomly and without announcement. New avenues of thought leading to revelations that would otherwise lie beyond my mortal reach.

I’ve started to comprehend things I could barely have conceived of back home, and though the onset of these notions had been terrifying at first, they grow less so with every passing day.

**AS:** No… no, I don’t trust you. I don’t-

**VOICE:** Your trust is immaterial. You will travel the road regardless.

The creature’s already stark glow starts to intensify.
 
**VOICE:** I’ve watched you, on every turn … across every moment of your journey.

One of the creature’s countless protrusions lashes out at the empty air, forming another harsh, glowing fissure. It wrenches itself open in a few stilted jolts, a transparent, almost crystalline membrane stretched across the gap. Through it, I can see myself, in the centre of a cornfield, examining a block of C4 explosive.

It’s as if I’m staring into the past through a jagged shard of one-way glass.

**VOICE:** I’ve watched you questioning.

Though we can’t be seen through the aperture, I see the glasslike membrane shake with the force of the creature’s voice. As the window collapses, I can see the rows of corn thrown into a frenzy.

A second arc lashes out at the sky, forming a second aperture. This time I’m expecting the sight before me. I see myself, crying in the forest… a silent radio by my side.

**VOICE:** I’ve watched you struggle.

The second window closes. The creature has made its point.

**VOICE:** I’ve watched you fight… to make your way here.

**VOICE:** You will not turn around. 

**AS:** You make it sound like I don’t have a choice.
 
**VOICE:** You do have a choice Alice, but you have already made it.

As much as I’ve grown to detest the creature’s presumption, in that moment, I know it’s right.

What it’s saying is true. I’ve done things I never would have imagined in order to get where I am now. In fact, if this being hadn’t arrived at all, I’d already be heading out over the bridge. 

I’m not proud of what drives me; that same, ugly impulse that led me to refuse Rob’s offer of return, that made it so easy to leave him behind in the silent city. But there’s no denying the impulse is there. It’s been with me the whole time, long before I ever arrived in Phoenix, Arizona… and it’s buried deeper than I’ve ever wanted to admit.

**AS:** Can I… do I get to say goodbye?
 
The entity says nothing. It hangs in the air, flickering and coursing with rupturing bolts of light. The next thing I hear is a faint mechanical hum emanating from the Wrangler behind me. Turning around, I pace briskly back to the car, opening the door and reaching into the passenger seat. My notebook is booting up, seemingly of its own accord.
 
Picking up the laptop, I lift the lid as I march back towards the bridge. I stare up at the silent being before me. When I look down to the laptop, my email client is already displayed on the screen.
 
**AS:** How… how long do I have?

**VOICE:** Long enough.
 
The entity begins to regress, its arcs diminishing as the being at its core turns away. Its message has been delivered. There is nothing more to discuss. 

As it passes through the gateway, into an unknowable world far removed from my own, I call out after it.
 
**AS:** I’m still not certain I trust you.
 
The being focusses on me once more, as the fracture begins to close. A final set of waves pass across the surface of the lake as it solemnly replies. 
 
**VOICE:** … I remember.
 
A moment later, the being is gone.
 
I stand motionless in the middle of the road, the entity’s final remarks washing over me, its curious choice of words echoing in my head. In the renewed silence, the faint stirrings of an overwhelming and terrible revelation start to form in my mind.

It could have simply said that it knew of my mistrust, that it heard the overtones in my voice, saw the disdain across my face or otherwise sensed it in the space between us. Instead, the being spoke as if my current feelings were a memory, dwelling somewhere within its depths.

It was undeniable that my time on the road was changing me, but in all this time I’d never truly considered how those changes might evolve as my journey continues. 

I’d never thought about what I might gain, what I might lose… or about what I might inevitably become.

A short while passes before I lower my eyes from the empty space above the bridge, to the screen of my notebook. Lowering myself down, I cross my legs and rest my back against the Wrangler.

If you’ve been reading from the beginning, you’ve finally caught up with me.

I hope you’ll allow me a few personal messages.

To Rob. I hope you’re able to read this someday, and I am so, so sorry for everything I’ve done; for everything I may do. I hope you understand that I didn’t know, and that none of this was your fault. You did the best you could, and the days I spent with you were the most significant of my life. It was an honour to know you and I hope that, among these pages, you find the answers, and the peace, that you deserve.

To my mum and dad, I’m sorry I won’t be sending this to you. In the end, I was carried along this road by a profound selfishness, and I just can’t bring myself to face you. I can’t imagine the pain I’ll be putting you through, and I won't try to justify my actions. All I can say is that I love you and I’m sorry that my last act towards you was one of cowardice.

And finally to you; the person to whom this message will be addressed. I’m sorry. I always thought I’d see you again someday, that the roads I took would eventually lead me home. That doesn’t look so likely now. Though I could say a lot to you, I’m not going to.

But I wish we could have been friends for longer.

It feels like a lifetime since I first arrived at Rob Guthard’s quiet street. I remember the uncertainty as I waited for him to open his door, with no concievable idea what was about to transpire. 

Like so many other things, that’s now changed. Despite being in an entirely new world, further from home than anyone’s ever been, I know exactly what’s going to happen next.

I’m going to take a drive. Take a left, then the next possible road on the right, then the next possible left. I will repeat the process ad infinitum, until I wind up somewhere new. 

And from there I’ll keep driving, beyond worlds, beyond time, beyond the bounds of my imagining. To a place where the lake runs dry, where the broken moon drifts away, and the stars disappear in the rear view.

To a place where everything has fallen away, and the road is all there is.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7tyb28/i_clear_out_apartments/?utm_source=reddit-android"&gt;Story 1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7u79r7/i_clean_out_apartments_story_2/?utm_source=reddit-android"&gt;Story 2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7ugfiz/i_clean_out_apartments_story_3/?utm_source=reddit-android"&gt;Story 3&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday we were called to an apartment to clean out after an older woman completely vanished. No family, no friends, no pet, nothing. And she has vanished, purse on the table, keys on the coffee table, with no telling where she could be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a very somber job, the team knew of the old lady, had seen her feeding birds in the courtyard of the complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we got to her room we noticed that one of our team members, Erik, had disappeared. At first we didn&amp;#39;t think anything of it because Erik did have the tendency to take a smoke break every once in a while, and he was pissed off at an out of state number that kept calling his phone every hour, so we went on with our job, thinking he was dealing with the asshole on the phone or smoking. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the longer we worked the more worried we got when Erik didn&amp;#39;t return, so Alex went and looked for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took about thirty minutes to scan the whole building inside and out but Erik was nowhere to be seen, and the working janitor on our floor said that he hadn&amp;#39;t seen Erik leave the apartment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, with the current old lady situation and the fact that we have shitty luck in the &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s probably not as weird as it sounds&amp;quot; department, we were pretty freaked out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to call Erik&amp;#39;s phone and, lo and behold, he answered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or we thought he did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hello?&amp;quot; Alex turned it on speaker phone and we huddled around. &amp;quot;Erik man this is a shitty prank we&amp;#39;ve got work to do.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no answer except a bit of static on the other end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Erik stop fucking around and come back to w-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all jumped back as there came an inhuman scream from the phone. It was double toned, blood chilling, and paired with what sounded like scratching on walls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst part was the fact that the same scratching noises were coming from the wall to our right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;#39;t call the police on this one. What would we have told them, that we think our friend got sucked into some eternal damnation realm in the living room of some old lady&amp;#39;s apartment?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we all decided to take the next couple of days off. Alex wants to call the police and at least file a missing person&amp;#39;s report. I think he thinks if Erik was playing a trick on us we would scare him into giving it up if we made it public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what to think. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. And it&amp;#39;s especially bad since the last twelve hours, on the hour, I&amp;#39;ve gotten a phone call from an out of state number. I&amp;#39;ve stopped answering it because all I hear on the other end is the same scream and whispers of my name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m afraid I&amp;#39;m next. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://redd.it/7uiphk"&gt;Part Two&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to recap: the first time I saw it was maybe three months after I started. The incident from my last story was about a year later. I don’t think I said before, but I started in the summer of 2014, so it’s been about three and a half years. So, the second incident was in the late fall of 2015. Through the winter months from end of ‘15 into ’16, I must have seen it twice a week. Every time, I did what I was told. Honestly, the biggest reason I didn’t do anything for a while was Jamal. I had to work with the guy, and every time I tried to even mention the thing, he would get so angry with me. He just kept telling me not to mess with it, not to talk to it or acknowledge it or even look at it. “Don’t look,” he kept telling me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You ever have someone tell you &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to think about something? It never works. For those months, I just couldn’t stop thinking about it. Because of course I couldn’t. That’s the way this shit works, right? I mean, some weird bullshit finds you, and it won’t let you go. No matter what you do, there it is, &lt;em&gt;staring&lt;/em&gt; at you, trying to get into your head, your soul, eating your whole fucking &lt;em&gt;life&lt;/em&gt;! Sorry, that’s not helpful, is it? I’m just, I’m pissed. Stuff has been happening more recently. I can’t really explain what’s happening right now until I explain what’s happened before but I just don’t know if I can take much more. I need to get through the next week. If I can make it through next week, I’ll be free and I’ll never have to worry about it again. I’ve made it over three years. I can make it one more week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look, it’s not like this stuff happened all the time, okay? I mean, yeah, during that winter it was bad. I saw it all the time, but I always did what I was told. I always walked away. I never looked at it, I never tried to talk to it. After a few months the thing seemed to get the message that I was doing what everyone else did and ignoring it. I remember it was spring and I realized I hadn’t seen it in a few weeks. I felt a release of tension I didn’t realize I was feeling. I thought maybe it was all going to be all right after all, maybe the thing left or decided I wasn’t worth the trouble. Nope. But you knew that, didn’t you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was summer of the same year, and I hadn’t seen it in months. I was out in one of the buildings, sweeping and picking up trash. There’s one particularly odd configuration of hall and units in one of the buildings where you have to turn a corner and there’s just a fire door on the right leading to the other half of the building, and a blank wall in front of you. I turned that corner and there it was. It was waiting for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I froze. I couldn’t even think about moving, couldn’t think about anything. My mind was blank, empty. It stared at me with those huge, multi-faceted eyes and then it raised its arm. The arm rotated from the shoulder, fingers pointed at me. We were maybe ten feet apart, and the fingers elongated, writhed through the air and slammed into my chest, up around the top of my sternum. They looked so soft, but they weren’t. Every little point they touched me, it felt like a hot wire pressed into my skin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I screamed, but that might have been only in my head. Certainly no one came rushing to save me. Those awful, wormy fingers pressed into my chest, it felt like they were going &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; my skin. Its face-tendrils waved and squirmed and pulled apart from each other and it whispered to me. It told me things I didn’t understand and couldn’t repeat. It told me its secrets, and it took mine from me, every unspoken desire, every desperate thought, every miserable lie I ever told. It took them all, and gave me all of its own. It told me its name. It told me everything. But I can’t remember any of it! I know that it told me these things as sure as I know my own name, but I just can’t remember what it said to me. I remember the sound of it, like distant crickets singing. It was beautiful. It was terrifying. It burrowed into mind and took what it wanted and left what it chose to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look, I know I said before I didn’t know what happened if you got stuck and there was no one to rescue you, and that’s true. I have no idea what really happened. Suddenly I was on the other side of that door picking up candy wrappers and soda bottles. At the moment, I decided to believe—or at least &lt;em&gt;pretend&lt;/em&gt; to believe—that it wasn’t real.
When I got home that night and changed my clothes, I found dozens of little brown dots on my chest. They weren’t red like a burn and they didn’t hurt, there were no marks on my shirt, but I suddenly had dozens of perfectly round freckles. So, I know it happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure how much more of this story I want to tell. I don’t think it likes me talking about it. I can’t sleep. I keep getting this feeling that it’s in the room with me, like it’s behind me while I’m typing this. I go to bed and I wake up, convinced it’s standing at the foot of the bed. I’m scared to open the shower curtain either direction. Every time I close my eyes, I’m sure that when I open them, it’s going to be there.&lt;/p&gt;

You ever have someone tell you *not* to think about something? It never works. For those months, I just couldn’t stop thinking about it. Because of course I couldn’t. That’s the way this shit works, right? I mean, some weird bullshit finds you, and it won’t let you go.

&lt;p&gt;So I’m 11 (I think you understand that by now) and I’m a boy. A real awesome boyish boy. I love getting muddy and riding my bike though giant puddles (my mum HATES that I do that because I get my clothes all dirty, but she never actually tries to stop me doing it so I think deep, deep, deeeeeeeeeeeeeeep down she loves that I’m still just a kid having fun :D) and I love hanging out with my friends, specifically my best buddy forever and ever Aaron! We have known each other since like second grade. Wait maybe first grade? No it was second! He was new to the school and really scared and I was his first friend! I walked right up to him on the first day and shouted “Boo!” in his face and we both started laughing. We’ve been best buddies ever since. I’m like his brother, I’m at his house all the time and the rest of the time he is at my house! His parents say I’m their second son basically. Anyway, back to the tasks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like a few days ago Aaron and I were hanging out at my place. It is our summer holidays at the moment so we have heaps of time to hang out. We were playing ping pong when Aaron slammed down the paddle and told me he was bored. Super bored. Not just of ping pong, just in general. He said he just wanted something exciting to happen and was sick of doing the same things. I mean I hadn’t really thought about it and Aaron hadn’t mentioned this before, but I guess I was bored too. I told him we should think of something different and more fun to do next time we hung out and Aaron agreed. He then opened his phone to text his parents that he was on his way home and took off on his bike. He seemed annoyed but I think he was just tired and bored of hanging out. I thought about what we could do next time for a few minutes but then I smelled the delicious smell of brownies and ran to the kitchen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway so the next day I texted Aaron and asked him if he wanted to hang out. I told him I thought about what he said and I think it would be fun if we like went to a rock climbing place or something! My mum said she wouldn’t mind taking us. I was excited. Aaron texted me back “I have a better idea!! Look in your post-box but do it quick before your mum sees.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Lol what!??! Ok u weirdo” I replied and I ran to the post box all stealth like (I pretended I was an FBI agent, it was pretty fun). I opened it up and saw a big white envelope, the same ones my dad has in his office. On the front it just said “Carter” in this weird wriggly writing, probably Aaron trying to be a weirdo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grabbed the envelope and ran back inside. I jumped onto my bed and ripped it open. Out fell a note and a small shovel. The note was written in the same squiggly writing apart from the top section which was clearly in Aaron’s messy normal writing which said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Aaron, we’ve been bored for a while so I fixed this. I spent all night planning an adventure for you! I’m so excited. I’m going to give you all these different clues and tasks for you to do. My job is to make the tasks! Then maybe at the end when you finish we can swap roles. Ok it sounds weird but you’ll understand it when you’ve done a few. Ok, read below now and pretend I didn’t write all of this! Pretend the tasks are from Agent Aaron not your friend Aaron. I swear it’ll be fun!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geez Aaron’s writing was messier than normal, and that’s saying something! And ok I did think it sounded weird at first but then I kept reading. The rest of the note was in the weird squiggly writing and it said this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You need to go to the address 47 Old Oak Street at 11:03pm tomorrow night. Wear all black. Find the flag. Bring the shovel and use it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read it and laughed. I texted Aaron&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: “Dude what the heck lol is this real?? My mum will never let me go out that late! I’d have to sneak out!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aaron: “Duh! You said you wanted fun. Come on, please. I’ve worked so hard on all these clues it’s going to be so fun I swear. Remember that scavenger hunt we did a few years ago with school? It’ll be like that but more fun!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: “Ahhhhh okay u’ve twisted my arm lol i’ll go. Are u gonna come down to?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aaron: “No that’s the point! I am giving you the secret tasks and I won’t see you until you’ve done them. It’ll only be a few days! Ok I’m not texting back anymore because from now on I am only Agent Aaron! If you need to reach me you have to text this number instead 04874627. It’s my agent phone. Ok bye!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: “Dude what? Fineeee. Ok. This better be worth it lol cya”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway so long story short I dressed all in black and crept out of the house and ran to Old Oak Street. It’s actually not far away, about a 15 minute walk but I got there in 7 minutes because I ran. I have passed the house before but never though much of it. It was about 11.05 when I got there, close enough to the time. I really didn’t have to look hard to find the flag, it was right in the middle of the front garden! It was cold and quiet, truth be told I was a little freaked out to be out so late alone but I quickly found the flag and started digging. It was hard work, I started sweating and had to take off my top 2 layers (I was wearing like 3 layers because it’s cold at night!!) and after digging for what felt like forever, I finally felt another envelope. I pulled it out and clung it to my chest while I laid down and panted. Geez, who’d have thought digging with a shovel was so much effort lol. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was laying down in the dark staring into the sky, I could have sworn I heard a camera click. Like I heard a click and saw a flash? I don’t know. It freaked me out a bit. I couldn’t see anyone though and I didn’t want to call out or anything because it was so late. I think I must have imagined it because I didn’t hear or see anything else so I quickly jumped up and got ready to leave. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t sure if I was meant to refill the hole? I felt bad leaving it but I really wanted to get home as it was about 12am now. I quickly kicked the dirt back in and ran home. I felt so safe when I finally got home and locked the door behind me. Don’t tell anyone though, I sound like a wuss! I crept back to my bed and opened the envelope. The note said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well done Carter, I am very proud of you for getting the first clue. Here is your next task:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 3pm tomorrow you must go to the local public pool. You must swim 5 laps in the outside pool and after this you must hold your breath for 30 seconds. If you are successful, your next clue will appear”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I am successful?!? I knew holding my breath would be a piece of freaking cake. I could hold it for 1 whole minute if i wanted! Anyway I thought it was a weird next task and but I was kind of enjoying this whole mystery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2:30pm the next day rolls around and I jumped on my bike to the swimming pool. I was half way down my drive when my mum comes running out and asked where I was going. I’d already told her before but she forgets. I said I was going to hang out with Aaron at the pools (lol it wasn’t really a lie technically...well maybe just a little one)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I zoomed to the pools, stripped down to my bathers and dived in..I did 5 laps. It was actually kinda fun but was also a bit cold so I was keen to get out. I looked around for the clue but couldn’t see it. I dove my head under the water and held my breath..30 seconds. EASY. I am so good at holding my breath. Anyway I come up gasping for air a bit and there, right by my shoes that I’d left on the side, was the clue. Whatt?!! Aaron must have put it there when I was under the water! I called out his name giggling because this was kind of funny and cool but I couldn’t see him anywhere and the lifeguard told me to shut up (lol). I asked the life guard if he’d seen my friend and he said no he hadn’t seen any kids. Aaron is good at being stealth like me though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ripped open the envelope then and there, and that is where you guys come in! The envelope had an ipad in it. The note inside said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well done Carter, you are up to clue 3. I’m so impressed with you. Nice swimming. Your next task is to go to unlock this ipad and go to the preloaded tab in Safari. This will take you to the nosleep sub, which is a group of people who will be able to help you with the upcoming tasks. I want you to tell them why we started doing this and your tasks and clues so far. After you have posted about this, you will get a text from me tomorrow with your next instructions. Bye Carter.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sooo here I am! I don’t really know who you guys are lol but this game is actually kinda creepy but fun! I am kind of bummed Aaron is so into it that I can’t text him for a normal convo though. Truth is I actually tried  to text his original number a few times to laugh about this game we’re doing, but no response. He is fully ignoring me. I tried texting the new number he gave me too but the response was just “Complete the tasks. Persevere with the tasks. Only text this number if you are confused about a task component and have a specific question.” It did not sound like Aaron at all (everything was spelled right? hahah), he was really getting into this role!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soo I don’t really know why I’m writing this. It said you guys will be helpful with my next task? I guess we will find out tomorrow! I can&amp;#39;t wait!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carter out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;
                    [selftext] => My name is Carter and I’m 11 years old. Yup, the big 11. Anyway I’m here because this is task number 3! Ok wait, you don’t really know about my tasks yet do you? I’d better explain a bit more. 


So I’m 11 (I think you understand that by now) and I’m a boy. A real awesome boyish boy. I love getting muddy and riding my bike though giant puddles (my mum HATES that I do that because I get my clothes all dirty, but she never actually tries to stop me doing it so I think deep, deep, deeeeeeeeeeeeeeep down she loves that I’m still just a kid having fun :D) and I love hanging out with my friends, specifically my best buddy forever and ever Aaron! We have known each other since like second grade. Wait maybe first grade? No it was second! He was new to the school and really scared and I was his first friend! I walked right up to him on the first day and shouted “Boo!” in his face and we both started laughing. We’ve been best buddies ever since. I’m like his brother, I’m at his house all the time and the rest of the time he is at my house! His parents say I’m their second son basically. Anyway, back to the tasks. 


Like a few days ago Aaron and I were hanging out at my place. It is our summer holidays at the moment so we have heaps of time to hang out. We were playing ping pong when Aaron slammed down the paddle and told me he was bored. Super bored. Not just of ping pong, just in general. He said he just wanted something exciting to happen and was sick of doing the same things. I mean I hadn’t really thought about it and Aaron hadn’t mentioned this before, but I guess I was bored too. I told him we should think of something different and more fun to do next time we hung out and Aaron agreed.

&lt;p&gt;I’m a research assistant working at a science facility in China. We’ve got one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world. We had to power it down a few months back to do some upgrades, and we’ve got a skeleton crew until it’s all done. Last night, my friend Chen and I were the only ones on the overnight shift. The majority of the hardware was up and running and we were supposed to be stress testing the nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had software we were required to run, but I had the bright idea to mine Bitcoins to test it instead. God knows those calculations can stress your hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn’t take much convincing to get Chen on board with the idea. If we could make a little extra money on the side from our endeavor, it was that much better. Besides, we could run the regular software after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chen downloaded the blockchain, installed everything, and we started processing. Lo and behold, BTC fractions started rolling in. It was way faster than either of us had expected. After an hour, we’d made a couple hundred USD. This supercomputer is something else. Adiabatic quantum emulation, baby. Not quite full QC, but close enough where it matters. When the upgrades go public, you’ll know what I’m talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that said...I think we fucked something up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were well on our way to our first thousand USD when Chen noticed one of the temperature gauges on a series of node clusters had reached a critical level. Now, each node is set to shut down automatically if anything is running in a manner that might damage the hardware. When stress testing, it’s expected that temperatures will get high enough to cause warnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weird thing was, the warning wasn’t because the temperature was too high. It was too low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We both looked at the screen with a good deal of confusion. All the nodes were pegging near their maximum temperatures except a cluster in the very rear corner of the football-field-sized room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Are those nodes on?” I asked Chen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He nodded. “Yeah, they’re doing just as much work as all the other ones. They should be hot.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Maybe the gauges are fucked?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Maybe. I’ll go take a look.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chen grabbed a walkie-talkie and started the long walk from the office to the far-end of the supercomputer room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched the screen readouts with interest. The temperature in that area kept dropping. Another few degrees and the nodes would power down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s fuckin freezing in here,” Chen complained over the walkie-talkie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You worked in a datacenter for six years, retard,” I replied. “You know it’s supposed to be cold.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I know, dick. But this is different. Like I think something’s really wrong. There’s frost on the floor.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took another look at the readouts. Despite the supercomputer operating at 99.997% capacity, all the temperature gauges had started to drop. A flash of red showed up on screen. The first nodes to be affected by the cold had shut down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Keung, you need to come in here,” Chen said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why, what’s up?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Just come see. And shut down the mining for a minute.” Chen paused. “And bring your jacket.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gazed lustfully at the BTC readout. $2443 already. I sighed and hit pause. I went to grab my jacket and decided against it. I wanted to call Chen a pussy for being cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After three steps into the supercomputer room, I realized Chen was not a pussy. Or that we both were pussies. Either way, it was fucking freezing in there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Holy shit!” Chen yelled. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I broke into a jog and met him on the far end of the cavernous room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What?” I asked. I shivered and balled my fists under my armpits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chen pointed. I followed his finger with my eyes and squinted to see better in the dimness. It took a second, but then I saw it. Hugging the wall around the corner from a server rack was...well...a hole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What the fuck?” I muttered. I took a step closer. The cold was borderline unbearable. It was definitely coming from the bizarre opening. Frigid wind washed over us and forced us to step back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the hole, there was gray, stony ground and pitch black sky dotted with stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What did we just do?” Chen asked. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Did we cause this to happen?” I replied. “Like what the fuck is going on?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hole was closing. I think Chen was about to respond, but before he could, some...thing... emerged from the hole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We both shrieked and leapt back. Chen fell into the back of one of the racks and I heard a piece of equipment snap. I didn’t care about that. My eyes were trained on whatever had just come out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was dull red and shaped like, oh hell, I don’t know, a mix between a pineapple and a crocodile with eye stalks all over its back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chen and I, our breaths held, tried to back away to avoid its attention. The creature’s eye stalks waved around in the air, as if trying to figure out what had happened. Behind it, the hole closed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grabbed the back of Chen’s shirt and pulled him to his feet. The thing’s stalks fixated on us. We stopped moving. It took a few steps in our direction on its six, pointy legs. Then it leapt forward. Onto Chen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chen made a sound I’d only previously associated with cats fighting for their lives. He grasped the dog-sized thing and pushed it away. It crashed into a rack of machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pulled Chen away and we ran as fast as we could back to the control room. Despite my terror-induced tunnel vision, I didn’t fail to notice another hole in supercomputer room. This time in the ceiling. And another one of those things was coming out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we were out, we had no idea what to do. Chen wanted to call the head of the supercomputing project but I talked him out of it. That guy had connections to the Party and, technically, the whole project is a government-run operation. We’d be fucked beyond fucked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I helped bandage Chen’s wounds. Every so often, we’d catch a glimpse of one of the creatures in the monitors overlooking the supercomputer room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a discussion, Chen and I left without telling anyone what we&amp;#39;d done. We didn’t go home because we knew people would be looking for us as soon as they discovered what had happened. We got in his car and drove for hours. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we’re sitting in an internet cafe. The scratches on his hands and arms aren’t closing up. They’re getting puffy and itchy. He just told me he thinks he felt something move under his skin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our phones wouldn’t stop ringing before I pulled out the SIMs and flushed them. Now we’re stuck here and we don’t know what to do. To say I’m concerned is a bit of an understatement. I’d really love &lt;a href="https://unsettlingstories.com"&gt;some advice.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    [selftext] => A little help? 

I’m a research assistant working at a science facility in China. We’ve got one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world. We had to power it down a few months back to do some upgrades, and we’ve got a skeleton crew until it’s all done. Last night, my friend Chen and I were the only ones on the overnight shift. The majority of the hardware was up and running and we were supposed to be stress testing the nodes.

We had software we were required to run, but I had the bright idea to mine Bitcoins to test it instead. God knows those calculations can stress your hardware.

It didn’t take much convincing to get Chen on board with the idea. If we could make a little extra money on the side from our endeavor, it was that much better. Besides, we could run the regular software after.

Chen downloaded the blockchain, installed everything, and we started processing. Lo and behold, BTC fractions started rolling in. It was way faster than either of us had expected. After an hour, we’d made a couple hundred USD. This supercomputer is something else. Adiabatic quantum emulation, baby. Not quite full QC, but close enough where it matters. When the upgrades go public, you’ll know what I’m talking about.

All that said...I think we fucked something up.

We were well on our way to our first thousand USD when Chen noticed one of the temperature gauges on a series of node clusters had reached a critical level. Now, each node is set to shut down automatically if anything is running in a manner that might damage the hardware. When stress testing, it’s expected that temperatures will get high enough to cause warnings.

The weird thing was, the warning wasn’t because the temperature was too high. It was too low.

We both looked at the screen with a good deal of confusion. All the nodes were pegging near their maximum temperatures except a cluster in the very rear corner of the football-field-sized room.

“Are those nodes on?” I asked Chen. 

He nodded. “Yeah, they’re doing just as much work as all the other ones. They should be hot.”

“Maybe the gauges are fucked?”

“Maybe. I’ll go take a look.”

Chen grabbed a walkie-talkie and started the long walk from the office to the far-end of the supercomputer room.

I watched the screen readouts with interest. The temperature in that area kept dropping. Another few degrees and the nodes would power down.

“It’s fuckin freezing in here,” Chen complained over the walkie-talkie.

“You worked in a datacenter for six years, retard,” I replied. “You know it’s supposed to be cold.”

“I know, dick. But this is different. Like I think something’s really wrong. There’s frost on the floor.”

I took another look at the readouts. Despite the supercomputer operating at 99.997% capacity, all the temperature gauges had started to drop. A flash of red showed up on screen. The first nodes to be affected by the cold had shut down.

“Keung, you need to come in here,” Chen said.

&lt;p&gt;Eleta has always been mature for her age. She never even liked to play pretend when she was little, which makes this even more concerning to me. Thankfully, she seems completely fine other than the times she pretends to talk to someone who isn’t there. She has so many friends that I can’t even remember all their names, she’s captain of the girl’s soccer and swimming teams, and she’s been a straight-A student since they started grading her with letters. I haven’t heard from any of teachers or coaches either, and I know they’d reach out if they noticed anything off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure it has something to do with the fact that her father died a few months back. My husband Clay was sick for years, the majority of Eleta’s life, so it wasn’t a shock to anyone when he passed. Of course, that doesn’t make it any easier. But I’ve never heard of high schoolers having imaginary friends, even in situations like this. I miss him more than I can put into words, but I’m not hallucinating, so I don’t think this is a normal part of the grieving process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eleta says the girl&amp;#39;s name is Mallory. I have no idea where she got that name. We don’t know anyone named Mallory. If I had to guess, I&amp;#39;d say she probably named her after one of those YouTube makeup artists she always watches. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time I tried to tell her Mallory isn’t real, she was more confused than upset. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But mom,” Eleta said slowly, looking at me like she wasn’t sure if I was joking or not. “She’s right here.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked at the seat next to her, my heart sinking. I saw no one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Okay, Eleta.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the weeks passed and she continued to have conversations with thin air, I couldn’t take it anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ve had enough of this,” I yelled, maybe a little louder than I intended. “There’s nobody there! Mallory doesn’t exist.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I saw the look on her face, I immediately wanted to take back my frustration. This wasn’t her fault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Look, next week, I’ll take you to a doctor so we can get to the bottom of this,” I tried to embrace her as she squirmed out of my arms and shoved me away. She had never laid a hand on me before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Eleta, please, you’re scaring me. I’m worried about you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without saying a word, she stomped out of the room and up the stairs. A few moments later, she reappeared holding a framed photo. When she got closer, I could feel my heart leap out of my chest. It was a family portrait I couldn’t remember taking, but there we were: me, Clay, and Eleta. It looked relatively recent, too. But there was someone else. A young girl I couldn’t recognize who had Clay’s eyes and smile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s Mallory,” She yelled, her angry eyes overflowing with tears.  “That’s &lt;a href="https://solomonslate.tumblr.com/"&gt;my little sister&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dave sent three texts within five minutes about half an hour after the first one. I finally broke down and opened them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grabbing some food from the grocery store. What do you want to eat?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Babe! Really need an answer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I grabbed taco stuff.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;R U mad?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sounded more like the Dave I knew but how could he send me the texts when I had his phone? He knows about all the latest gadgets but a lot are out of his budget. He didn’t have a smart watch or anything else like that. Besides I thought they had to be near the phone to work anyhow.  Since I calmed down and his text was so normal sounding, I decided to see what would happen if I texted him back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Will you be home soon?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heard his phone play my text tone. I waited to see if there would be a reply all the while hardly daring to breath. Maybe ten minutes went by before I heard someone unlocking the door. As I skidded around the corner to see who it was, Dave stepped inside with two arms full of grocery bags. And he looked just fine. No signs of his earlier sickness at all. He gave me a strange look as he stepped around me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Guess you’re feeling better.” I was confused and mad at him for not updating me. Okay, I’ll admit I was mad because I was hurt. I was so worried about him, he had looked awful and he couldn’t care enough to let me know he was okay? Maybe it was childish of me but it was the way I felt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m fine. Don’t know why you insisted I take the day off if you were going to work.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What? You were sick as hell this morning!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He looked at me puzzled. “Are you okay? I wasn’t sick, you insisted I stay home because you wanted a day together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’d never do that. You were puking your guts out and you had a fever. I wanted to call an ambulance but you wouldn’t let me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He set the groceries down and turned toward me. I began to question my sanity because he was genuinely confused. I must have had the same look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Let’s put these away and then figure this out.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just nodded like an idiot. He didn’t look sick now but I hadn’t imagined the whole scene from the morning. I had never felt such terror in my life. We put the groceries away in silence. At one point Dave held up the chicken soup I had brought for him, he placed it in the fridge after glancing at me briefly. When that task was done we both sat on the couch together just looking at one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Where’s your phone?” It wasn’t what I meant to ask but it’s what came out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Right here.” He dug into his pocket and then began patting himself down. He started to look panicky and I couldn’t take it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You left it here. It’s in your room.” Before the words were out of my mouth he was running for the bedroom. He returned with his phone clutched to his chest. He looked angry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Did you look at it?” It wasn’t a question but a demand. That made me angry and I stood up, I stood in front of him so we were toe to toe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It fell on the floor when I was cleaning YOUR room. I was cleaning your room because I was worried about you. And yes, the screen lit up and I saw my text and another one saying someone needed you. No I did not unlock your phone and riffle through it because I TRUST you. I would rather let you explain yourself then jump to suspicions.” And as quick as that I was crying. I tried to hide it because I hate crying and I wasn’t trying to manipulate him. I’ve never been the type of person to use tears to further an argument or make someone feel bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He wouldn’t let me pull away from his embrace, so I ended up sobbing into his shoulder. “Shh, babe. I didn’t mean it like that. I’m sorry. I just don’t want you hurt. Shh.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sniffled and wiped my eyes with my sleeve like a five year old. I felt stupid for my break down, because I constantly battle feelings of losing him. I loved him and I trusted him, but I was scared he would find someone better. It had happened to me before and I hadn’t loved that man the way I loved Dave. A realization that left me speechless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What is going on? You can tell me anything.” I managed to whisper this but I know he heard me. Dave held my shoulders and looked into my eyes. His eyes were bright with unshed tears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Look, I’d tell you if I could but I don’t want you sucked into this. This isn’t about you, okay? I got myself into a stupid situation and am trying to figure out how to get out of it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Is it drugs? I can help you if you tell me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s not drugs.” He looked surprised by this question. “Just trust me for a bit longer. Please just hang in here with me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s what happened the other day. He insists he texted me that he had to help out a friend last minute and that he hadn’t been drinking at all. He doesn’t remember getting home or being sick. He won’t budge on the story that I made him take off of work. The links to the game stopped coming also because I told him I didn’t want to play it. Besides all that, he has been…. Normal. Until this morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up to the most ear splitting alarm issuing from his phone. Dave was trying to get to it to shut it off but he kept jerking as if being shocked. The alarm kept changing tones, it felt like nails were being pounded through my eyes. Until it just shut off. Silence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to ask him abut it but he simply told me DON’T. He was pale when he got up. He brought me a glass of water and then we snuggled together. It was a wonderful lazy time. We drowsed, touched, kissed and even made love. Everything was slow and sweet. Then the text came. My head was on his chest and it was hard to miss the bold words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;LEXI WANTS YOU BAD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dave just rolled me off of him without a word and began getting dressed. I tried to ask what was going on but he looked right through me. His eyes were dull not the normal bright green eyes I was just looking into moments before. I actually begged him to tell me he wasn’t going to another woman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I can’t.” Was all he said in a monotone. So I did something I am ashamed of. I told him it was her or me and if he walked out the door then I would be gone. The door slammed behind him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was at nine this morning. Of course I packed up and went back to my place. I’ve been a wreck because I promised to trust him and stick this out but did he mean letting him run off to other women? I’ve had four messages from him. All of them a link to that damn game! The last had a message typed just above the link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m sorry. This explains it all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been doing this for 5 years, but I still get a chill when I have to go out into the &amp;#39;field&amp;#39;. Healer Owoya says this might help with the shock, but I don&amp;#39;t know. It&amp;#39;s one thing to go out and see a gory mess caused by one of these things; it&amp;#39;s another thing to get into their heads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst cases are the subtle, bloodless incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly bloodless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kelpies actually eat their victims, after all. And you can&amp;#39;t reason with them easily. At least you can ask a Succuna or a Aswang why they ate someone&amp;#39;s husband, child, or whoever was unfortunate enough to cross them under the right (or horrendous) circumstances. Usually the answer is that it&amp;#39;s in their nature, or they were cursed that way, or just because they love eating babies, but it&amp;#39;s still chillling to hear their sheer joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A kelpie has none of that. It&amp;#39;s a beast, acting on instinct, like an animal driven to hunt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mundane officers had sealed off the pond where the body of the latest victim had been found. Their bloated arm and leg had been found, at least. I ducked under the bright yellow tape, and walked up to the man in charge, a haggard looking veteran of the force who chewed on his cigarette, his lip curling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re the one they sent over?&amp;quot; I chose not to answer, sensing that they had more to say, &amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t look like much.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The insult was ignored, and I went on, &amp;quot;I did my research on this already.&amp;quot; His face hardened; I hadn&amp;#39;t risen to his bait, &amp;quot;It looks like you have a kelpie problem.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stooped down to the body parts; despite their bloated and rancid state, I could see the sharp, uneven marks on it. No precise killer had done this; the blame lay on a ravenous spirit. &amp;quot;No wild animal did this either. You all found entrails as well, right?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We did.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Kelpie don&amp;#39;t like entrails. It&amp;#39;s almost like eating shit for them, so like petulant children with veggies, they throw them to the side.&amp;quot; I stood back up, barely coming to his chest. The officer peered down at me, &amp;quot;Did the victim have a reputation for loving animals?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He was an animal rescuer.&amp;quot; He snorted, spitting a loogie into the lake. My brow twitched; the kelpie wouldn&amp;#39;t like that. &amp;quot;People said he used to go the extra mile to help animals out.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Explains how the kelpie was able to lure him in. Probably took the form of a cute or emaciated pup, managed to attract the guy&amp;#39;s attention. Poor guy probably didn&amp;#39;t realize this thing wasn&amp;#39;t a dog until he was halfway through being dragged to his death. By then it was way too late. I began peeling off my clothes to reveal a wetsuit underneath. Alarmed, the chief demmanded,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The hell are you doing?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Bureau policy is that if there&amp;#39;s a Kelpie down there, we gotta capture and relocate it. If I can get that thing to come peacefully, it&amp;#39;s best for all of us. If I can&amp;#39;t...&amp;quot; I gave him a wide, sharp-toothed grin, and saw him blanch, &amp;quot;I hope you&amp;#39;ve got lots and lots of guns.&amp;quot; With that, I dove into the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I suspected, the bottom of the deep pond was littered with human refuse...and human bones. Kelpies didn&amp;#39;t much like regular animals. Maybe they felt a kinship with the common beasts and didn&amp;#39;t seek to harm them. The water was uncommonly still, a heavy, opressive air in what would otherwise be a soothing area. My friend was nearby, but apaprently judging whether I was foe, friend, or food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Movement caught my eye, and I could smell the decay as I drew closer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their true form, kelpie are monstrous abominations that perhaps faintly resemble horses. With its bulging eyes, mouth filled with razor-sharp teeth, and eyes a milky blue-white, the one who was mere feet from me was one of the more pleasant one to look at. It stood three or four hands taller than the average horse, and I could see where mold and moss and grown on its mottled brown coat. Sea-grass and barnacles in its mane and on its hooves, half submerged in the mud of the pond, told me that this Kelpie was not native to this area, but a transplant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;...&amp;quot; It studied me silently, and I peered at it. After a long moment, I decided that it was time to allow it to smell me, and carefully reached out my hand. Hopefully I didn&amp;#39;t smell too much like mundanes for it to attack me. It allowed me to put my hand on its snout, and I resisted the urge to shudder. It felt...slick. Slimy. Even the water, I could feel the years of mildew on it. My fingers were inches from its deadly mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The imagery flashed through my head faster than I could comprehend. There was fear, hunger, and rage. Someone had uprooted this kelpie from its home lake, and this area was so deserted that it rarely found a meal. The transport of kelpie outside of Scotland was illegal. We were all the way in Washington, America. There were sinister implications that I would need time to research, but my job wasn&amp;#39;t to figure out who was trafficking these creatures, it was to get them to a safe location where they couldn&amp;#39;t hurt anyone and no one could hurt them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;...I can help you.&amp;quot; It blinked at me, understanding, &amp;quot;But you have to come quietly.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a single moment, I thought the kelpie might rear up at me and bite my throat out, maybe snack on my heart and lungs. Instead, it let out a rumbling noise, a affirmative noise. The faintest relief bloomed in my chest as I returned to the surface to tell the chief the news. Quickly, my relief turned to annoyance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;...That thing has been down there for at least 40 years.&amp;quot; I narrowed my eyes at him, &amp;quot;...Why&amp;#39;d you wait until now to contact us?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There wasn&amp;#39;t any reason to contact you before.&amp;quot; His eyes flicked away from mine, and I snorted,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Bullshit.&amp;quot; I tilted my head, &amp;quot;Kelpies eat at least a couple times a year. You could make the excuse that this one was intelligent enough to target drifters, but forty years? That&amp;#39;s 80 people going missing while it&amp;#39;s been here. Maybe more.&amp;quot; I could see him sweating. There was a coverup going on at this department, but I could always request the missing persons report going back for that time period. Letting out a snort, I shook my head. Mundanes, so concerned with looks that they were willing to let both their own and these creatures suffer. I looked around, the officers with their guns, and pulled out a phone, sending a text off to my people. &amp;quot;The BSA can take it from here; our subject has agreed to come peacefully.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This is our jurisdiction...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And this is mine.&amp;quot; I gave him a wide, unblinking grimace, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s best if you don&amp;#39;t interfere, Chief. Otherwise that body count is going to go up by at least one today.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His Adam&amp;#39;s apple jumped up and down, and finally he backed off, stepping away with a glower and barking orders at his men to pack up. The next of kin of this latest victim would need to be alerted, the excuse that a wild animal had set upon him during one of his jaunts and done him in would need to be given. As my people pulled up, equipment and all, I looked back to the lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kelpie was near the surface, and balefully stared at me. The bloodlust was there, but it was full. And it was lonely. I think it was ready to go to where it had company, away from this isolated, backwater American town. As it was loaded into the transporter, the mundane officers looking on in semi-digust, semi-fascination, I turned away. My cell beeped with a text relaying that I needed to return to HQ. My work here was done, and I had a log to record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And...this is my first record. Hopefully Healer Owoya will stop doubting my fitness for duty now. It&amp;#39;s one of the tamer jobs I&amp;#39;ve been on, but trust me. That was a rare one. There will always be the things that go bump in the night, that humans don&amp;#39;t understand. I was used to seeing what lurked in the minds of the beasts.&lt;/p&gt;

                    [selftext] => Log No. 1:

I've been doing this for 5 years, but I still get a chill when I have to go out into the 'field'. Healer Owoya says this might help with the shock, but I don't know. It's one thing to go out and see a gory mess caused by one of these things; it's another thing to get into their heads.

The worst cases are the subtle, bloodless incidents.

Well.

Mostly bloodless.

Kelpies actually eat their victims, after all. And you can't reason with them easily. At least you can ask a Succuna or a Aswang why they ate someone's husband, child, or whoever was unfortunate enough to cross them under the right (or horrendous) circumstances.

                    [selftext_html] => &lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For several months of the year I work as a volunteer fire lookout at a rather large national park. There are several towers, most abandoned now, but year after year I keep returning, and now I’m the only lookout left. It takes a special type of person to lock themselves away from civilisation for months at a time, the only contact with the outside world being an old-fashioned handheld radio and the occasional wayward hiker, but I enjoy the solitude. It gives me a lot of time to read and write, and to enjoy nature like I’m the only person left in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I get visits from lost hikers and I help guide them on their way. Nobody knows the park like I do. I’ve been doing this for close to twenty years now, and I used to think that they would have to pry that radio from my cold, dead hands. That time almost came sooner than I thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen a lot of strange things during my time as a lookout. Lights in the distance that I can’t explain, footprints that don’t match any animal I’ve ever seen, not to mention some of the howls and growls you hear deep in the night when it’s nothing but you and nature as far as the eye can see. But perhaps the scariest thing of all happened during my watch last year. The only thing to ever make me reconsider my decision to go back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the height of summer. The days were long and the nights atop the mountain short and extremely cold. From my tower I could see two others in the distance, forming a triangle. There were no longer in use, but the local government hired them out as cheap accommodation for daring hikers who wanted a new experience. I could see the flickering light of a fire in the tower to my right, but the other was dark. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I checked over all the data I had recorded for the day, got into my sleeping bag and went to sleep for the night. The next day passed uneventfully; I had an early breakfast, made my recordings, went for a walk and read on the balcony until the sun went down. The stars at night when there are no other lights around are unlike anything you’ve ever seen before. You realise how small and insignificant you are, looking up at the lights of suns billions of years old and billions of light years away. It helps put the modern rat-race in perspective and is one of the reasons I enjoy my job so much. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So on this particular night I put my book down and went inside to boil a pot of tea when I spotted something in the distance. Two lights, like a pair of eyes. They were too far away to actually be eyes, but they looked like eyes, nevertheless. Just floating there, watching me. They disappeared and then appeared again, like a blink, and then they were gone. It was silly, because it wasn’t like anything down there would be able to see me, but I sat beneath the window and hid myself just in case, heart beating in my chest. Sometimes superstition can get the better of you, and recently there had been rumours of a creature living in the woods. They called it “The Beast of Leda Point.” Like I said, I’ve worked here for twenty years and I’ve never seen any beast. But it’s good for tourism; we get a lot of hikers asking about it and coming out this way specifically to find it. I never outright tell them it doesn’t exist because that’s not what they want to hear, but I’ve never seen any evidence of such a beast. Just bears and occasionally the grizzly remains of hikers who ignored the warning signs posted all over the park as they traveled off the beaten track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next night I saw a light in the other tower while the one to my right was now dark. Must have been some new residents for the night. It was comforting, like, despite the fact I was in the middle of nowhere, all alone, there was still someone else out here with me. Sure, they were several miles away and in an emergency there was no possible way to reach them in time, but the thought that fellow human beings were there, like me, but most importantly not disturbing me, well it was like a warm blanket on a cold winter’s night. We could enjoy our solitude together, but also far apart. Just how I liked it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was getting ready to jump into my sleeping bag for the night when I heard the familiar crackle of the radio. It was a woman’s voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hello? Hello, is anyone out there? Please, if you can hear me, respond.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I picked it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hello, ma’am. This is lookout tower five, how may I be of assistance?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The radio frequencies for the towers around the park were posted on signs throughout the woods, just in case people got lost. No-one knew the place better than we did, after all, and now that my tower was the only one manned by staff, all calls eventually came through to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hello? Yes! Oh, thank god! I thought I was all alone out here. I’ve rented one of the towers for the night but I took a wrong turn somewhere and now I don’t know where I am!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I received at least ten to twenty of these distress calls every year, of which at least a few were hikers who couldn’t find their way to the lookout towers. I stretched and moved over to the park map by the wall.  The fire was flickering in tower three to my left, so she was likely looking for tower four, the dark one to my right. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Can you tell me what you see around you? Any landmarks?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The radio crackled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Um. I’m not sure. There are a lot of trees. I passed a small river about 10 minutes ago if that helps?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The park is full of rivers. I needed something a little more concrete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Uhh… I think I see something up ahead… a cave? I think it’s a cave.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a small cave system between towers five and three; she was a long way from tower four. There was no way I could direct her there before morning, so I decided to send her towards my tower. Not the peaceful night I wanted, but not like I was going to sit around and let a woman freeze to death in the woods over it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Okay, I want you to listen very carefully. You’re a long way from Tower Four. I’m going to put my lights on and I want you to head for the light. I’ll check in five or ten minutes to see that you’re heading in the right direction.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Okay. I’m… I really scared. I heard something in the trees before and I don’t know if it was a bear or what but I really don’t want to be out here anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was what I was afraid of. Black bears were particularly numerous in that area, and it was a wonder she hadn’t stumbled upon one already. I lit up the fireplace and the lanterns on each of the corners outside and went back in to wait. It would take her perhaps an hour to reach the lookout tower. That was a long time out in the dark, all alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ma’am, are you there?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes, I’m here,” the radio crackled back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“How are things going?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Okay, I think. I can see lights. I’m heading for them now.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Okay, that’s great. So, what brings you out this way, anyway?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Me? Oh, I’m a bit of a folklore buff, actually. I like nature trails and I heard the rumours about the ‘Beast of Leda Point’ so I thought I’d check it out for myself.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There it was again. The Beast of Leda Point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I see. Did you have any luck locating it?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Not yet.” I could hear the smile in her voice. “But it’s out here, I’m sure of it! Did you know that the first sighting of it was only a few years ago? And I say ‘sighting’ because nobody can claim to have actually seen it. It only appears before those it plans to kill, or so they say. Did you also know that the first rumblings of the beast in these woods were started by someone who received a voice message from their friend as they in the midst of being attacked?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had heard that particular rumour, yes. No-one knew exactly when they began, but before long the park was full of hikers looking for this mysterious beast. She continued on, her voice rising as she got more and more excited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The only description he had to go off was what his friend left on his phone before he died. Tall, possibly over ten feet, with thick black hair. Now, you might just think that was a bear, right? But no, that wasn’t what stood out to this man who described it with his dying breaths. It was the creature’s eyes. They glowed yellow in the dark. Not like a cat. More like… a firefly, you might say. Rather poetic, don’t you think?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I swallowed, remembering what I saw the night before. The way she described the creature was like a mother talking about a child. I never did understand those folklore hunters. But as long as she kept talking, I knew she was safe. I just needed to get her here and then I could redirect her in the morning and reclaim my peaceful solitude. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But the best part was his final words, before he was torn to pieces. Do you know what he said? I heard the recording. You can find it on the internet if you look hard enough.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had zero interest in listening to a dying man’s last words hidden somewhere on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What did he say?” I asked, trying to keep her talking. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“‘It sounds like me.’ What do you suppose that means?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had no idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I couldn’t say.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Strange, isn’t it? How could a beast talk, let alone imitate a man’s voice? Aren’t beasts supposed to be stupid? They grunt and growl and we find their footprints in the mud and take blurry pictures of them with bad cameras. What if this one isn’t? Think of the possibilities!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urban legends weren’t really my cup of tea, but to each their own. We chatted for a while about this and that, whatever I could to keep checking in on her and to confirm she was okay. I looked at the clock. By all estimates she should have been nearing the tower at this point, all going well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Can you see anything to identify where you are? Can you see the lookout tower lights?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I can see the lights.” She sounded breathless. “I’ve been climbing uphill for a while now, but I should be there soon!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I closed my eyes and sighed in relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Okay. I’ll keep the radio nearby, but there’s a lock on the fence surrounding the tower. It’s to keep the bears out, but the key should be in it. I’ll brew some tea for your arrival and we’ll get you some help for the morning. You’re very lucky, you know. Several hikers have gone missing in those woods, and they don’t always turn up alive.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh, I know,” she replied. “Thank you for your help. I’ll see you soon.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The radio went silent. I put the kettle on and set about making some tea. I waited, and close to half an hour passed before I picked the radio up again. There was no sign of the woman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hello?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing but crackle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ma’am? Are you there?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No answer. I moved to the window and looked outside, but when I did, my heart froze in my throat. It was those eyes, glowing in the distance. They were close to tower three. But not just one pair of eyes… this time there were two. They were faint, but I could see them, like stars twinkling in the distance. Then they disappeared. I ran for the radio and set the frequency for tower three. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hello? Hello?! Come in! Is anyone there?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again there was no answer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Shit!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no phone reception that high in the mountains. That’s why we have to rely on the radios. I locked the door, for what little good it would do, and began pacing. I tried again, but still no answer. I couldn’t call HQ just because I saw a few lights in the distance. What were they going to do? The nearest help would take half an hour to arrive, and that wasn’t including the time they would spend laughing at me first. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I climbed into my sleeping bag and huddled with the radio. What could I do? I tried both frequencies but was met with nothing but silence. I placed it on the cabinet next to me and huddled. I stared at the wall for hours, hyper-conscious of every sound and movement around me. At some point I must have fallen asleep, because I was woken several hours later by the sound of the radio crackling. The lanterns around the cabin had burnt out; I was surrounded by darkness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hello?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the woman’s voice. Then there was a cough, and the voice changed. This time the voice was deeper. A man’s voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Thank you for the directions. I was actually looking for your tower, but it seems I got confused somewhere along the way. I am kinda new around here after all. No matter. I like you. Let’s chat again sometime.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The radio went silent. I couldn’t move. I didn’t know what to say or what to think. I was sure I was dreaming. Just one big crazy nightmare. The following evening I received news from HQ that the hikers staying in tower three had been found dead. Two young men. They’d also received a missing person’s report of a young woman that had gone hiking in the mountains the day before. She got separated from her group and no-one had been able to find her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t tell them about what I saw. What I heard. No-one would believe me even if I did. But a chill ran through my body and I seriously considered HQ’s offer for an early end to the season. Nothing like a violent murder or two to put a damper on the mood. There were no suspects. The gate to the fence surrounding the tower was wide open when authorities finally arrived, the key nowhere to be found. Nothing was taken from the room, nor was there any sign of animal entry. The towers were built to prohibit this, especially from grizzlies, so the authorities were stumped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished out the season. We’re starting to get close to the period where I need to let HQ if I’m coming back for the next season or not. I’ve been thinking more and more about what happened. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Let’s chat again sometime.’ &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love my job, but the more I think about what happened, and the uncanny quietness of the months that followed the attack… I’m not so sure if I want to go back &lt;a href="http://taraadevlin.com/"&gt;anymore&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;
                    [selftext] => For several months of the year I work as a volunteer fire lookout at a rather large national park. There are several towers, most abandoned now, but year after year I keep returning, and now I’m the only lookout left. It takes a special type of person to lock themselves away from civilisation for months at a time, the only contact with the outside world being an old-fashioned handheld radio and the occasional wayward hiker, but I enjoy the solitude. It gives me a lot of time to read and write, and to enjoy nature like I’m the only person left in the world.

Sometimes I get visits from lost hikers and I help guide them on their way. Nobody knows the park like I do. I’ve been doing this for close to twenty years now, and I used to think that they would have to pry that radio from my cold, dead hands. That time almost came sooner than I thought.

I’ve seen a lot of strange things during my time as a lookout. Lights in the distance that I can’t explain, footprints that don’t match any animal I’ve ever seen, not to mention some of the howls and growls you hear deep in the night when it’s nothing but you and nature as far as the eye can see. But perhaps the scariest thing of all happened during my watch last year. The only thing to ever make me reconsider my decision to go back. 

It was the height of summer. The days were long and the nights atop the mountain short and extremely cold. From my tower I could see two others in the distance, forming a triangle. There were no longer in use, but the local government hired them out as cheap accommodation for daring hikers who wanted a new experience. I could see the flickering light of a fire in the tower to my right, but the other was dark. 

I checked over all the data I had recorded for the day, got into my sleeping bag and went to sleep for the night. The next day passed uneventfully; I had an early breakfast, made my recordings, went for a walk and read on the balcony until the sun went down. The stars at night when there are no other lights around are unlike anything you’ve ever seen before. You realise how small and insignificant you are, looking up at the lights of suns billions of years old and billions of light years away. It helps put the modern rat-race in perspective and is one of the reasons I enjoy my job so much. 

So on this particular night I put my book down and went inside to boil a pot of tea when I spotted something in the distance. Two lights, like a pair of eyes. They were too far away to actually be eyes, but they looked like eyes, nevertheless. Just floating there, watching me. They disappeared and then appeared again, like a blink, and then they were gone. It was silly, because it wasn’t like anything down there would be able to see me, but I sat beneath the window and hid myself just in case, heart beating in my chest. Sometimes superstition can get the better of you, and recently there had been rumours of a creature living in the woods. They called it “The Beast of Leda Point.” Like I said, I’ve worked here for twenty years and I’ve never seen any beast. But it’s good for tourism; we get a lot of hikers asking about it and coming out this way specifically to find it. I never outright tell them it doesn’t exist because that’s not what they want to hear, but I’ve never seen any evidence of such a beast. Just bears and occasionally the grizzly remains of hikers who ignored the warning signs posted all over the park as they traveled off the beaten track.

The next night I saw a light in the other tower while the one to my right was now dark. Must have been some new residents for the night. It was comforting, like, despite the fact I was in the middle of nowhere, all alone, there was still someone else out here with me. Sure, they were several miles away and in an emergency there was no possible way to reach them in time, but the thought that fellow human beings were there, like me, but most importantly not disturbing me, well it was like a warm blanket on a cold winter’s night. We could enjoy our solitude together, but also far apart. Just how I liked it. 

I was getting ready to jump into my sleeping bag for the night when I heard the familiar crackle of the radio. It was a woman’s voice.

“Hello? Hello, is anyone out there? Please, if you can hear me, respond.”

I picked it up.

“Hello, ma’am. This is lookout tower five, how may I be of assistance?”

The radio frequencies for the towers around the park were posted on signs throughout the woods, just in case people got lost. No-one knew the place better than we did, after all, and now that my tower was the only one manned by staff, all calls eventually came through to me.

&lt;p&gt;I’m a normal guy, been married for a couple of years and both the wife and I have regular desk jobs. Nothing out of the ordinary ever happens to us, we’re just there, like most people in the world I guess. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think we’ve ever had any particular bedroom fantasies of our own. Sure, we might’ve gotten a bit kinky once or twice – or at least &lt;em&gt;tried&lt;/em&gt; to – but that’s about it. Nothing weird, taboo or violent at all, though. I’m fine if that’s what gets others off, but it was never a “thing” for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I started having those dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time I dreamed about cutting off my wife’s head was just… so &lt;em&gt;surreal&lt;/em&gt;. I’m not even sure how to describe it. I remember feeling, or rather, &lt;em&gt;knowing&lt;/em&gt; that the whole thing was wrong and fucked up, but every passing moment that sensation would be overshadowed by an increasing and uncanny sense of happiness and pure ecstasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up shortly after, and felt disgusted with the contents of my dream as I started to recall all the bits and pieces. I had never dreamed about anything like that before. Sure, I’ve had nightmares like everyone else, but I never dreamed about injuring and killing loved ones &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; feeling happy about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, to my horror, I noticed my raging erection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t know what to think of it at first. I felt extremely confused and nauseated about the whole thing, but I just assumed it was the typical morning wood and that was it… and yet, I was so… How do I put it… It feels so wrong and cringy to talk about this and write it down, I know I’m a grown man but… It was hard, is what I mean. Like, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hard, so much so that it wasn’t just going away, so I rubbed one out before going to work. One wasn’t enough, and we’ll leave it at that. No, I didn’t think of my wife’s butchered body and yes, I did take a longer shower due to how filthy and gross I felt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look, I don’t even enjoy horror movies or violent things that much. That’s just not me. My wife and I are also doing absolutely fine, as well as our baby daughter. Yes, we haven’t been intimate that often because of the baby, but that’s only normal, right? It’s just how things are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I genuinely thought it would’ve stopped there, but no, it wasn’t just that one dream. Of course I didn’t dream about the same thing every single night, but eventually the dreams became more frequent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I’d be using a knife to do the deed, other times I’d be using nothing but my bare hands to rip her head apart from her body. There were also a few instances where her head would already be off &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; I’d done anything to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also want to make it clear that there was never any pain involved. In fact, she always seemed quite happy, as were I. My dream-self just knew that we were both happy, and that we both wanted it. It wasn’t just me, it was a &lt;em&gt;shared&lt;/em&gt; effort. She wanted it too, and always seemed pleased with the end result. Even with her head off, she’d be conscious and all smiles afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t understand why I was dreaming about those things, but eventually I grew tired of looking up dream meanings and possible interpretations. I briefly considered going to a psychologist or something, but ultimately was too ashamed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to play it cool at first, but eventually my wife noticed that something was off, that there was something &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; behind the sudden jolt in my sex drive. It seems that, without me even realizing it, I’d started giving her neck a ton of attention. She complained about the tight neck gripping as well as the biting. She didn’t exactly say she didn’t &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; it – more like, it was something to be explored by the two of us and not just me, which is absolutely fair and normal – but she was concerned about leaving any visible marks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tried some things for a short while, but it simply wasn’t working out and I could tell that the whole thing was starting to affect her. Seeing her look at me almost like I’d become a stranger of sorts also made me feel like crap. There was just no way I would’ve been able to keep it going, so I broke down and told her all about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It came as a shock to her, that’s for sure. She’d been thinking and dreading a lot of things – like me having an affair or something – but had never expected something of the sort. She was concerned, really concerned for what this meant for our family, but I believe she quickly realized that I was still the same old me, it’s just that those strange dreams brought these side-effects along with them and there was just no way to turn them off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talked a lot, and eventually decided to try and work it out for ourselves before reaching out for professional help if it came to that. One day she came home from work and handed me half a dozen pictures. Being a graphic designer and knowing a ton about special effects, she had decided to alter some of her pictures so they’d please my strange fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some of them she’d have her throat cut with lots of blood spilling out, and others had just her freshly severed head on display. She said she felt weird making those, but that it was still kind of fun somehow. If this isn’t wife material, I don’t know what is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The altered pictures did their thing for a while, but it just wasn’t enough. Now that I think about it, actually &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt; such realistic depictions of my dreams with my own eyes only made me crave the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; thing even more. I wanted to see her &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; neck wounded, wanted to feel the cuts on my fingers and taste the dried gash on my tongue. I know this sounds terrible, but I’m being honest here. It’s just what I felt like and I’m trying to be truthful here. It’s like my brain decided to re-wire itself just to screw with me and I couldn’t help it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, we talked. She was very apprehensive and scared about anything involving actual pain, as anyone would be, but she was willing to try because of us and everything we have. She also asked me if I felt like I could ever “&lt;em&gt;do it&lt;/em&gt;” for real, something that hurt my feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Of course not” is what I told her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I might be just a simpleton, but I’m not fucking stupid. I can still tell the difference between fact and fiction. It’s one thing to live out your fantasies repeatedly inside your own head, but to actually do it for real? If anything, I’d be able to only do it once… and then what? I’d be stuck forever with nothing, and there’s no guarantee that the dreams would persist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I would never kill my wife, obviously. Why would I? So I’d get put in jail and have my baby daughter thrown into foster care? Something might’ve changed inside me, but I’m still a husband and a dad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So anyways, we talked and agreed on one thing: a nail clipper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what I would use to make little cuts over and around her throat. We both felt comfortable enough with it, and it wasn’t as scary as me wielding an actual knife. I mean, I didn’t even &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to use a knife because I wasn’t really sure if I could be trusted with it. With a nail clipper there just wasn’t a way for me to cause her great but unintended harm. Also we could always say that the baby scratched her, in case anyone asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also mentioned we could get a cat when we decided to move up to wider and deeper cuts, you know, to have a valid excuse, but I think she ignored that idea. She never commented on it and I realized it would be smart to not bring it up again anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be completely honest, I was somewhat disappointed when we agreed on a mere nail clipper, but hey at least it was something… and that something sure did the trick. I was so anxious and hyped throughout the whole thing, the nail clipper kept sliding out of my hands due to all the sweat. Eventually I managed to pinch a tiny fold of the skin on her throat and finally clipped it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never expected anything to come of it, but when I saw a tiny little amount of blood forming in the freshly made incision… It’s like everything stopped. It felt like a fucking biblical revelation to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That little speck of blood was almost like the end of a thread taunting me, teasing me to pull at it and unravel the whole thing. That first, insignificant cut proved how &lt;em&gt;easily&lt;/em&gt; my dreams could become a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made love the entire night, and I didn’t even think about picking up the nail clipper a second time. No, just that one cut had been enough, and I had become fixated on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Transfixed&lt;/em&gt; by it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The feel of its texture and the taste it harbored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could almost feel it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could almost &lt;em&gt;taste&lt;/em&gt; my dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember catching a glimpse of her mixed expression. I could tell she never came that harder before, but knowing what was &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; turning me on, the whole situation… yes, it was weird and still holding her back, yet I knew I could make her so much happier if she just let me. I could make my, no, &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; dreams come true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, by the time I woke up in morning she was gone, along with our daughter. I didn’t really understand why at first, maybe she was scared due to how much she enjoyed it herself. She let me know that it was best for the two of us to take a break, and for me to seek some sort of help or treatment in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was hurt by the whole thing seeing as it was so sudden and right after the best night in my entire &lt;em&gt;life&lt;/em&gt;, but she was right. I know she went away because she loved me, and she wanted me to get it under control… so I did. I mean, why wouldn’t I? I told you I loved my wife. It was the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been a couple of months now. We’re talking, but she hasn’t moved back in just yet. It’s a slow process, as I’m sure some of you might know, but at least she lets me see our daughter and look after her every other day when she has other commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t dreamed about my wife in a while now. I’m always reluctant to fall asleep, wondering if the dreams will come back at some point, but I don’t think they will… Either way, I have to remain optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what I say to myself and my daughter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t really have any friends to talk to, so sometimes I just like to ramble and talk to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know she’s too young to understand a word of what I’m saying, but I do it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tell her she has nothing to worry about, that I don’t have “mommy dreams” anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tell her that &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; is the star of my dreams now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She’s all I can think about, day and night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also got a cat.&lt;/p&gt;

                    [selftext_html] => &lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have lived in the barren hills of North Carolina for eighteen years. My great grandfather built my family’s home, and when my parents passed, the manor was mine to inherit. There was only one other house in the hills, the Welles house. They had lived there before I had been born, and remained there to this. I didn’t pay much attention to them when I was younger. When I was 10 however, I remember watching an ambulance and cop cars pull up there driveway. The Welles boy committed suicide. I understood what suicide was, but I didn’t understand why he did it. When I was in my teens, I woke up startled in the night to screams and shouts. The mother had ran outside after hearing her husband. He had gotten out of his truck drunk, and forgot to put it in park. It went backwards and crushed his body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Welles mother then lived out her days with her daughters and her other son. I remember vaguely the night I snuck over and slept with one of her daughters. Another time me and her son Henry went out into the woods. I wasn’t very fond of him, and I regretfully remember knocking him into the pond. I stayed in the house for a weak, in fear the Welles boy would come out and get some revenge. Years passed and our connection with the Welles vanished. The last reminder was when I was about to move far from the hills, the mother died. I assume Henry inherited the house, and I left South Carolina. It wasn’t until my younger sister called me to inform me my father had passed away. My mother died not long after I moved. I had a difficult choice on my hand, I could either sell the home, or move back home. Of course, I knew deep down my father would’ve wanted me to return to the hills, so I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moving trucks took most of my things from my cramped studio apartment. I had lived in Chicago working for a design company. The switch from loud city life back to urban was tough. Upon revival, I was disgusted to find the conditions of the house. The manor was fairly large, there were three floors. The first floor was our kitchen, family rooms, and our caretakers quarters. The second and third were mostly dedicated to rooms and studies. My family was fairly large, there was my parents, my three sisters, four brothers, and my grandfather had stayed with us for awhile. Most of the lights had stopped working in the house. The water faucets were shut off, and mold grew in most rooms. I had much to do, my fathers funeral needed to be planned, the house payments had to be payed, and I had yet to call my siblings to ask about the house, but a visit to the Welles was my main priority. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made my way over to the Welles house. The lawn was overgrown. The stone foundations were cracked. The paint was chipped and had turned a brownish color. The old manor look liked a dying giant. I knocked on the door and it opened immediately. The hastiness of this bothered me, but the thought left my mind. Henry Welles was standing in the door frame. He had become very pale, his face seemed to sag from his head. He was also fairly skinny, and his hair was overgrown and greasy. He greeted me and requested that I come in. I denied, but he insisted. The first thing I noticed about the house was the smell. It seems Henry did not take care of himself nor the house. The second was the clutter, the hallway was stuffed with boxes and tubs. He asked me to sit, and we caught up. I asked about his sisters and how the house has been, and he told me they were doing very good, and the house had “aged” as he put it. I politely asked to leave, and was making my way out when he mumbled “We don’t want you on these hills”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was sitting down on the kitchen table when I saw the time. It was late, so I closed my laptop, took my medicine, and walked up to bed. I turned the light switch on to no avail. I plugged in my phone to find out no electricity worked in this room, but I was too tired to complain so I went to bed. I woke up that night to the sound of wind pushing against the house. I couldn’t tell what time it was, so I opened the blinds to see the Welles house. There were four windows open, lights shining in each. The silhouettes of four bodies stood in the window, staring back at the house, back at me. I did not sleep that night, every noise made my body tense. When light shined through my blinds, I got in my car and went into town. I was looking for a job, something to hold me over for awhile. After picking up some food, I returned to the manor with dread. I knew I would get no sleep that night if I didn’t know for sure what I saw. I hesitantly visited Henry once more. He insisted again that I must come in, but I denied. I asked if any of the Welles were visiting. He told me no, and requested again that I come in. I staggered away, and I refused to look back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Night came again on the hills, and I found a room which had running power. I kept the light on for a couple of hours, and I felt like a little kid again. I shut the light off, and tried my best to fall asleep, but the temptation of opening the blinds came over me. I needed to know, I had too. The house lights were on again, the four silhouettes again. Anger swelled over me, I leaped from my bed and stormed downstairs. Henry was still upset about the pond, he planned this. He wanted to scare me away. I was at the Welles house again, my feet were bare, all I was wearing was a white shirt and shorts. I realized quickly how absurd this was, but I heard a chuckle. From the corner of my eyes I saw a man sprint from the house into the woods. I chased after, running down the hill chasing after the man. I caught up soon enough to see that it was Henry Welles, he was standing in front of the pond. He turned to me and chuckled, then fell backwards into the water. My mind went blank, I looked down into the black water, I couldn’t decide to jump in or leave him. But my choice came to me, a skeleton floated up from the water. It bobbed in the water, then sank again. I walked back to the manor. I did not run, I was too scared to run. I called the police that night to aware them of the body. I got a call that morning from the police. Telling me they took the body back to the station, they were able to identify it fairly quickly. I left the hills that day, after the police told me who it was. “It was that boy” “The one from the hill, he disappeared for almost ten years, Henry Welles”&lt;/p&gt;

                    [selftext_html] => &lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As previously mentioned there have been requests for a case including the cryptid known colloquially as Bigfoot. This is an unusual cryptid, in which the incidents involving are often just sightings of something big in the woods. But there have been journals from long-term hikers and campers who have had prolonged encounters with these cryptids. There is also one autopsy for a Bigfoot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mortician who conducted that autopsy was inconsolable for months afterwards. He has recently returned to work. He has also request counselling until further notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CASEFILE - BIGFOOT/CIVILIAN #011&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A weathered looking journal was found on a picnic table in a large national park. For obvious reasons, the exact location has will not be included. Park Ranger retrieved the journal, and after trying to find out the identity of the owner, the subsequent report made it to us, where we retrieved the journal and spoke with the Park Ranger. The Park Ranger agreed to not mention anything about this journal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The camper who wrote this journal had gone on a &amp;#39;rediscovery adventure&amp;#39;. They stated how they hadn&amp;#39;t been connected to the outdoors for a period of eight years and greatly missed the tranquillity. Having gone on a sabbatical, they did the appropriate level of research for the area they were going to, had gotten equipment to replace old gear. They did some training to keep fit for the long hikes, spoke with the Park Rangers and left. The details were removed from the relevant databases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beginning of the journal is a descriptive journey, making mapping the beginning quite easy. Two weeks in, is the first indication that there was something preternatural afoot. The sense of being watched, and the occasional muffled snap of a branch being broken. This went on for around six days. The person did not indicate any trepidation regarding these events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of days after the sense of being watched stopped, the camper detailed an encounter with two very gruff looking men. They had an almost feral look in their eyes, and their presence was intensely unsettling. Their communication was rough, almost punctuated with growls. Their leering gaze made the camper very uncomfortable. As they took one step closer, they both stopped simultaneously. They looked around, like kids caught with their hand in the cookie jar. A gasp escaped their lips and they bolted away. It wouldn&amp;#39;t be until later that the camper would recognise the look and behavior. It was that of the &amp;#39;Startled Prey&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The writing is in cursive. and had been fluent throughout the journal so far. The night after that encounter, the camper noted that instead of feeling refreshed like they normally had since their excursion, they felt mentally exhausted. Careful examination noted that the cursive was not as flowing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the next week, the fluency of the cursive writing was deteriorating, and block lettering was being used in place of it. Repeated mention of a recurring dream, the camper describes the ineffable urge to stand in the middle of a clearing next to a large silhouette of a humanoid. The dream would just consist of the two of them standing there for hours on end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the aforementioned week, the camper detailed the first proper encounter with a Bigfoot. Or to be more precise, the Bigfoot from the dream. Exiting their tent to cook an evening meal, the camper noticed the presence immediately. A large humanoid, approximately 9 feet tall, stood half-hidden behind a tree at the edge of the small clearing the camper was camping in. Instead of fear, the camper felt a sense of serenity. The camper nodded to the Bigfoot then cooked their meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The camper had trouble putting into words what happened next because while he did engage in a form of communication, due to the nature of how the conversation took place, putting it into words seemed difficult as five pages were filled with writing which was crossed out on multiple occasions. From what could be ascertained, the Bigfoot would telepathically impart the concept of something into the campers mind. For this instance, it was the concept of cooking food. Not the description of it, but the concept. It seemed a little hazy, as if unsure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The camper went tried to explain vocally about the process of cooking one&amp;#39;s food, but the Bigfoot reinforced the idea, and instead of cooking, the focus was on the process of cooking. It took a while, but it seemed that the Bigfoot was looking for an invitation to join the camper for the evening meal. The camper tried to form the image of the two of them sitting together to eat, which the Bigfoot took as the invitation it was meant to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For around ten days, this guest would be invited to join for the evening meal, and they would sit and eat. The meat would have to be cooler for the Bigfoot to enjoy properly. The writing was getting thicker. As if the hand writing the information down was heavier than normal. Since the likelihood of the camper gaining such a significant amount of mass to allow this event to occur, the mystery would remain unsolved until the end of the journal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the ten days, the Bigfoot put forth the concept of community. The camper put forth the sense of citylife, while shaking his head. The Bigfoot frowned, then sent the concept again, but this time the focus was on community in the forest, with other Bigfoot. After a while, the camper agreed. The belongings were packed, and the pair walked off into the woods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wouldn&amp;#39;t be until they got to the location the Bigfoot was leading him too, that the camper noticed that he was finally able to stand eye to eye with his large quiet friend. Three more journal entries followed, but the language was very broken English. Like trying to describe through concepts in as few words as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entry that the morticians found interesting was no the communal aspect of Bigfoot culture, but when the two saw those men, the concept of wrongness, imagined as a black fog with a large red cross in it surrounding those two, and then an image of an endless corridor of trees like a hellish maze. Small food items like berries were used as the concept for small amount of food near the bad men&amp;#39;s feet with an early sunrise. It was agreed that the Bigfoot due to their telepathic nature could cause people to become lost in their forest through telepathic manipulation, and while not violent, did leave enough food for the two bad men so they would not die due to starvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CASEFILE - BIGFOOT AUTOPSY #01&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bigfoot in question was found dead in a National Park somewhere within the US. Since the Park Ranger wanted to be vocal about this discovery, he was gaslit into alcoholism, which given his family background took little effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bigfoot was 9 and a half feet tall. His mass weighed in at around 380 pounds. There was very little fat. The Mortician who conducted the autopsy noted that the hair was soft to the touch, and the skin was tough to cut through. Preliminary examination showed significant injuries to the torso and the arms. Scratch marks indicated a skinwalker, due to the variety of Necrotizing fasciitis in the wounds. What was startling was that there were antibodies for the infections, preventing any decomposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The musculature was incredibly dense, as was the bone structure. The killing blow seemed to be when the claws of the skinwalker penetrated the heart. There were no adrenal glands within the Bigfoot, nor were there any reproductive organs. But judging by the above mentioned journal, it seems that these cryptids can ... infect others, but only the ones they choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would state that Bigfoot are a higher form of cryptid. While their communicative abilities are unique they have shown to be capable of communicating with others, and their ability to show mercy, when they could have easily killed those men indicates a higher level of communicative awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

                    [selftext] => As previously mentioned there have been requests for a case including the cryptid known colloquially as Bigfoot. This is an unusual cryptid, in which the incidents involving are often just sightings of something big in the woods. But there have been journals from long-term hikers and campers who have had prolonged encounters with these cryptids. There is also one autopsy for a Bigfoot.

The mortician who conducted that autopsy was inconsolable for months afterwards. He has recently returned to work. He has also request counselling until further notice.

CASEFILE - BIGFOOT/CIVILIAN #011

A weathered looking journal was found on a picnic table in a large national park. For obvious reasons, the exact location has will not be included. Park Ranger retrieved the journal, and after trying to find out the identity of the owner, the subsequent report made it to us, where we retrieved the journal and spoke with the Park Ranger. The Park Ranger agreed to not mention anything about this journal.

The camper who wrote this journal had gone on a 'rediscovery adventure'. They stated how they hadn't been connected to the outdoors for a period of eight years and greatly missed the tranquillity. Having gone on a sabbatical, they did the appropriate level of research for the area they were going to, had gotten equipment to replace old gear. They did some training to keep fit for the long hikes, spoke with the Park Rangers and left. The details were removed from the relevant databases.

The beginning of the journal is a descriptive journey, making mapping the beginning quite easy. Two weeks in, is the first indication that there was something preternatural afoot. The sense of being watched, and the occasional muffled snap of a branch being broken. This went on for around six days. The person did not indicate any trepidation regarding these events.

A couple of days after the sense of being watched stopped, the camper detailed an encounter with two very gruff looking men. They had an almost feral look in their eyes, and their presence was intensely unsettling. Their communication was rough, almost punctuated with growls. Their leering gaze made the camper very uncomfortable. As they took one step closer, they both stopped simultaneously. They looked around, like kids caught with their hand in the cookie jar. A gasp escaped their lips and they bolted away. It wouldn't be until later that the camper would recognise the look and behavior. It was that of the 'Startled Prey'.

The writing is in cursive. and had been fluent throughout the journal so far. The night after that encounter, the camper noted that instead of feeling refreshed like they normally had since their excursion, they felt mentally exhausted. Careful examination noted that the cursive was not as flowing.

For the next week, the fluency of the cursive writing was deteriorating, and block lettering was being used in place of it. Repeated mention of a recurring dream, the camper describes the ineffable urge to stand in the middle of a clearing next to a large silhouette of a humanoid. The dream would just consist of the two of them standing there for hours on end.

After the aforementioned week, the camper detailed the first proper encounter with a Bigfoot. Or to be more precise, the Bigfoot from the dream. Exiting their tent to cook an evening meal, the camper noticed the presence immediately. A large humanoid, approximately 9 feet tall, stood half-hidden behind a tree at the edge of the small clearing the camper was camping in. Instead of fear, the camper felt a sense of serenity. The camper nodded to the Bigfoot then cooked their meal.

The camper had trouble putting into words what happened next because while he did engage in a form of communication, due to the nature of how the conversation took place, putting it into words seemed difficult as five pages were filled with writing which was crossed out on multiple occasions. From what could be ascertained, the Bigfoot would telepathically impart the concept of something into the campers mind. For this instance, it was the concept of cooking food. Not the description of it, but the concept. It seemed a little hazy, as if unsure.

The camper went tried to explain vocally about the process of cooking one's food, but the Bigfoot reinforced the idea, and instead of cooking, the focus was on the process of cooking. It took a while, but it seemed that the Bigfoot was looking for an invitation to join the camper for the evening meal. The camper tried to form the image of the two of them sitting together to eat, which the Bigfoot took as the invitation it was meant to be.

For around ten days, this guest would be invited to join for the evening meal, and they would sit and eat. The meat would have to be cooler for the Bigfoot to enjoy properly. The writing was getting thicker. As if the hand writing the information down was heavier than normal. Since the likelihood of the camper gaining such a significant amount of mass to allow this event to occur, the mystery would remain unsolved until the end of the journal.

After the ten days, the Bigfoot put forth the concept of community. The camper put forth the sense of citylife, while shaking his head. The Bigfoot frowned, then sent the concept again, but this time the focus was on community in the forest, with other Bigfoot. After a while, the camper agreed.

                    [selftext_html] => &lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I moved into this apartment building a couple weeks ago. It’s been pretty alright, except for the fact that the girl across the hall won’t stop screaming. It gets especially bad at night. I consider myself a heavy sleeper, but nobody can get a decent amount of shut-eye when there’s this awful, tinny screeching ringing in your ears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She’ll scream for what feels like hours, then maybe ten or fifteen minutes of silence, and she’s right back at it. Sometimes it’s more garbled and punctuated by low sobbing noises. There’s enough space between us that the sound is relatively muffled, but still loud enough to be a major nuisance. Look, I know I might sound like an asshole, but it really is rather distracting, especially when I’m just trying to watch Netflix or read a few chapters of a good book. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to be polite at first and chose to ignore it for a few days. When things didn’t get better on their own, I knocked on her door, ready to ask her to pipe down, but there was no response—if anything, she got even &lt;em&gt;louder&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started blasting music on my speakers, trying to give her a taste of her own medicine and all. &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; was about as effective as yelling at a brick wall. It was passive-aggressive, I admit, but it was really starting to get to me. When she got particularly loud, I could&amp;#39;ve sworn it felt like the whole building was weeping with her, the floor vibrating with misery. I asked the landlord what was up with the girl in 607, but he just laughed and told me to make sure I kept my doors locked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I was really at the end of my rope. I promise I&amp;#39;m usually not a confrontational person, but some things you’ve just got to take into your own hands. It must’ve been two or three in the morning when I threw myself out of bed and made a beeline for her apartment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Open up,” I yelled, rapping on the door with my fist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The screaming didn’t even waver in volume. It was clearer than ever now that I was standing only meters away from the source, and I noticed for the first time just how pitchy and strained it really was, like a wounded animal. Every few seconds she’d stop to take these huge, gasping breaths of air. I wrinkled my nose. It was like listening to a little kid throw a tantrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I said &lt;em&gt;open up&lt;/em&gt;.” I gave the door a solid kick, which kind of hurt since I was only wearing slippers. “Seriously, we’ve got to talk.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I got a reaction. She quieted down for a few moments before breaking out into fresh sobs. Guess I’d personally offended her or something. I was about to swallow my pride and head back when the door swung open with a soft &lt;em&gt;click&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stepped inside. I could hear her sobbing clearly now, but the apartment was pitch-dark, and I couldn’t pinpoint exactly where it was coming from. I felt blindly along the walls for a light switch, but quickly jerked my hand back when it met with a moist, soft surface. Grimacing, I wiped it on my pajama pants. “Hey, could you just quiet down?” I asked. “I don’t know if you’re going through some stuff right now, but the rest of us have still got to sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She whimpered and made a wet sniffling noise. The sound seemed to come from all around me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ll take that as a yes,” I said, exasperated. After a moment of acclimatizing, I noticed how hot and humid it was inside the room, and the smell of something like wet dog fur in the air. I was practically standing in the middle of the world’s grossest sauna. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to get out of there as fast as possible, but I’d gotten all turned around in the blackness. I blinked. My eyes started to adjust, and I could see weird, blobby forms taking shape in the dark, but I couldn’t quite make sense of them. There were the contours of a lamp about a meter away, and I staggered towards it and turned it on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second the light came on, the screams returned in terrifying force, so loud that I immediately clamped my hands down over my ears. The floor was literally shaking beneath my feet, and as I scrambled to shut the light off, my vision was reduced to a smear of pink and red. For a brief moment, I could see something pulsating and alive, a shapeless, raw mass that had spread itself over the ceiling and walls. “Okay, okay!” I yelled, but I couldn’t even hear myself, just its rabid howling. “Geez.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hurried out of the room and only lowered my hands for a brief second to slam the door shut behind me. Back in my own apartment, I jammed earplugs halfway up my ear canals and laid curled on my bed for the rest of the night, wide awake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She still hasn’t shut up.&lt;/p&gt;

                    [selftext_html] => &lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was eleven when I was taken. A small-framed, bubbly, blonde girl with pigtails, I wasn’t afraid of anything.  I guess that’s my parent’s mistake. “Stranger Danger” wasn’t in my vocabulary. When he pulled up next to me, and said he was lost, I didn’t fear him. His old van in park, he pulled out a map, and asked if I could help. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My naïve blue eyes scanned him. He was about 45, with dark hair, military style, with a mustache. His brown sunglasses glinted in the sunlight. His wife was there, too, further decreasing my fight or flight response. Pretty, with black hair and dark features, she smiled, showing a full set of the most beautiful, white teeth I’ve ever seen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re looking for the four-oh-five,” he said, waiving me over closer so I could look at his map. I was confused, I’d never heard of that highway, though, being eleven, I was more focused on my Hanson obsession than local geography. I wanted to be helpful, however, and these folks looked nice. I leaned against the chipping brown paint, scanning the map in his lap. I frowned. Nothing looked familiar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shook my head, “Are you sure that’s a map of this area?” Hanging my jump rope over my shoulder, I leaned in and pointed to a section of the map, “The mountains are to the west, not to the east. And I’m pretty sure there’s no ocean around here.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man smiled. “You know, I think you’re right.” He motioned for me to stand back a bit, and he opened his door. “Here,” he said, flipping through the pages, “Does this look right?” He was holding the map so far in, towards his wife, I had to lean over his lap, bracing myself on the steering wheel and standing on the runner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah,” I agreed, pointing at a lake. “That’s Union Reservoir.  We’re about here,” I touched the map. “I still don’t see a four-oh-five, though.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hmm,” he said. Looking at his wife, he muttered, “This one?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She nodded, flashing her teeth again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all happened so fast. Grabbing my pigtail, he pulled hard, causing me to go up on my tippy-toes. “OW!” I yelled, and that’s when his large hand covered my mouth, pressing, suffocating. There was a rag in his hand I hadn’t noticed before. I smelled chemicals, and everything went black. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The van hit a large pothole, jarring me awake. I tried to move, but the duct tape around my ankles and wrists held tight, biting into my skin. Looking out the small windows on the back doors, it looked past nightfall. In my foggy state, the only thing I could think of was how pissed my parents were going to be. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“She’s awake,” the woman said quietly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw the man glance into his rearview mirror. Smiling, he said, “We’re almost home.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Home? I thought to myself. Where’s home? My home? Or his home?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to speak, but with the ball-gag in my mouth, it came out muffled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Shh,” he cooed, “We’ll be home soon, and I’ll show you your new room.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fear finally filled my brain, taking over. I couldn’t breathe. Reality hit like a ton of bricks. I’d never see my family again. I’d never see my sister, or my cat, or my little hamster. My parents would go sick with worry. Tears welled up in my eyes, spilling down my cheeks and over the gag, landing with a gentle splash on the hard metal floor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After what seemed like hours, but was probably only minutes, the van came to a halt. The man and woman exited the vehicle, and I tried to worm my way up, away from the back doors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throwing the doors open, the man reached in, grabbed me by my shoe, causing it to flicker with colors. “Cool shoes,” he said, sliding me toward him and standing me up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small cabin stood in front of us, its porch light shining through the darkness. From what I could see, it looked like we were somewhere deep in the woods, probably up the Rocky Mountains. Pushing his fingers into my back, he muttered, “Start hopping.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing my best not to fall, I made small little hops towards the cabin, my sobbing breaths casting a mist around us. My eyes darting all around, looking for an escape route, I wasn’t looking where I was going and I tripped and landed hard in the dirt, causing the woman to sigh in frustration. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She grabbed me hard by my arm, lifting me up, her nails biting into the soft flesh. “You need to watch where you’re going,” she scolded harshly, “If you get hurt, we’re not taking you to the hospital, so stop.” My eyes widened. This was the first hint of anything but kindness from them, despite the kidnapping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cabin was small and sparsely furnished. It smelled like dirt and aftershave and dead things. Animal heads hung from the wall, watching me as I hopped through the room. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man now took over, leading me to the back of the cabin and down a narrow set of rickety stairs. He reached up and pulled a chain, flooding the room with light. I squinted around. The basement looked largely unfinished. The only thing in the room was a small iron cage in the corner and a shower curtain set up to swing around it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked at him, my eyes wide with fear. He smiled and nodded. “This is your new room, baby girl.” He shoved me in first, and he followed, closing the curtain behind him. He forced me to sit on the blankets on the floor and removed a small hunting knife from his boot. Running the blade gently along my neck, he grinned when I whimpered. “That’s right,” he whispered, his breath stale and hot. “I’m in charge. You do as I say, always.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one motion, he cut through the tape on my ankles and wrists. Gently removing the gag, he asked, “Now… What’s your name?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tears ran down my face as I choked out, “C-Cassie.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Cassie,” he said, running his hand along my thigh. “That’s an awfully pretty name. You’re such a pretty little girl.” His hand grazed my stomach, making me recoil from him. It felt wrong, so wrong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His entire demeanor changed. “Fine,” he said, pushing me down hard while he stood up. “Someday, you’ll learn to enjoy it.” He slammed the door of the cage closed and swiftly left the basement, leaving me in the dark, sobbing and shaking. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Part 2 coming soon. There&amp;#39;s a lot to tell, spanning over five years, so please be patient, but I want to share my story with you.)&lt;/p&gt;

                    [selftext_html] => &lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was twelve, my mother and I moved to a small coastal community in South Georgia, about half a mile from the ocean. We lived in a shanty, but it was big enough for the two of us. My father was never around; he was a hustler and a gambler who’d left before I was born. My mother worked as a cashier in town and was usually out of the house, so I had a certain amount of freedom.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I’d walk for hours, exploring the trails behind our home, looking for new and interesting things along the beach. I’d trudge through the brush until the mosquitos and ticks ate me alive. I didn’t care, I&amp;#39;d become used to bugs since moving there.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our neighbor’s property was totally infested with cockroaches. An exterminator told us they’d nested in our basement too. The bugs would come out at night and bite my mother and me in our sleep. Sometimes I’d find them crawling in my clothes, they were literally everywhere, so I tried spending as much time as I could outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I attempted building a fort in this bush in our backyard, which never came to fruition. I couldn’t find enough materials to finish the darn thing. I spent the better part of each evening searching the trails for supplies but found mostly junk. I had a bad habit of collecting everything though, everything I could find. I’d stack it in our neighbor’s yard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One evening I was searching the trails and found something truly magnificent. It was the best thing I’d ever discovered. I must’ve walked by it a hundred times, but had never noticed it before. It was a large seashell, a beautiful seashell, the kind you could hold up to your ear to hear the ocean. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Wow, look at that!” I said.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d wished there’d been someone to share the discovery with; it was the biggest shell I’d ever seen.
It was white with an arrangement of rainbow-colored dots, almost like a tie-dye shirt. I figured it would be a great present for my mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I picked it up; it was heavy like a rock. It’d been there a while, the surface was all dusty. I polished it up with my tee-shirt which really brought out the shine. I couldn’t believe how beautiful the thing was. It glistened in the sun like a diamond. I put it up to my ear and it hissed like the ocean, it was so loud!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Mom will love this,” I thought to myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put the giant shell in my backpack and took it to my fort for safe keeping until mother got home from work. I kept putting it up to my ear and listening to the noise. I knew the real ocean was only half a mile away, but something about the sound coming from the shell was so soothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to wash the thing off before I gave it to my mother; it seemed to be full of sand. I used a small spigot in the backyard to fill it up and I shook everything around. 
I got the idea to hold the shell up to my ear as the water drained out, thinking it might sound cool. I listened as the water sloshed around inside the shell. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was having a great time until I felt a sharp pain in my inner-ear. It made my spine jerk and my face go numb. It felt like someone had jabbed a hot knife into my brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to scream, but the signals in my head were crossed. I was frozen stiff. The pain was so incredible I felt dizzy, like I might fall over.
I dropped the seashell onto the pavement and it shattered into a hundred little pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t think straight. I pulled and tugged at my ear with my hand, but it wasn’t helping. I was overcome with confusion and my ears were ringing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I noticed something was in my hand. What was it? I held my hand closer and saw a bunch of tiny cockroaches staring back at me. I screamed. I shook my hands wildly.
I looked down at the pavement, it was covered in baby roaches. They were swarming from the broken shell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The center of the shell was filled with hay and covered in a cornucopia of insects... I realized that one had probably gone out the shell and into my head when I was listening to the ocean. I could feel something moving around in there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began sobbing uncontrollably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I clawed my fingers deep into the canal, digging as far back as possible, but couldn’t reach the thing. I could feel it tunneling deeper, scratching away the skin inside my eardrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fell on the ground, succumbing to the intense pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What could I do? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was sobbing so much I could barely open my eyes. I crawled over to the spigot and sprayed a bit of water in my ear, but the insect burrowed even deeper. It sounded like one of those old dial-up internet connections inside my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to stay as calm as possible until my mother got home. I didn’t think I was allowed to call an ambulance so I just laid out on our front porch, waiting for her to pull up.  She’d worked a late-shift that night and didn’t come home till it was past dark. I’d fallen asleep and woke up when her lights came in the driveway. I got up and noticed a small pool of blood had formed where I was lying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mother took me to the emergency room and the doctors used a special tool to scrape out the bug. It was dug in so deep they had to cut out some of the tissue. They said this kind of thing was more common than people think; sometimes people have no idea their head is infested with different types of insects. I found that really surprising. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The doctor performed a cranial x-ray and found other roaches had made their way deeper into my brainstem. The scariest part was that he wasn’t sure how long they’d been there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was prescribed some really strong medicine for a few months that made me sick, but it supposedly killed all the bugs in my head. I’m completely deaf in my left ear and have problems identifying certain smells, although I think it was a side-effect of the medicine. Even though I’m an adult now, I regularly visit the doctor to get x-rayed for parasites. Sometimes I&amp;#39;ll hear that buzzing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized this can truly happen to anyone. Your head is actually cozier for insects than people like to think. Try not to eat food in bed, as this can attract insects which may burrow while you are sleeping. It can be difficult to know when insects have nested inside these areas of your body, as there aren’t always early-warning signs. If insects lay eggs in these areas, they can cause permanent damage to the brainstem and central nervous system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you notice any strange noises inside your head or are frequently experiencing headaches, PLEASE visit your doctor for an x-ray. I know it sounds scary, but it’s better than having bugs living inside your head…trust me. If they go in, they don&amp;#39;t always come out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;

                    [selftext] => When I was twelve, my mother and I moved to a small coastal community in South Georgia, about half a mile from the ocean. We lived in a shanty, but it was big enough for the two of us. My father was never around; he was a hustler and a gambler who’d left before I was born. My mother worked as a cashier in town and was usually out of the house, so I had a certain amount of freedom.  


Sometimes I’d walk for hours, exploring the trails behind our home, looking for new and interesting things along the beach. I’d trudge through the brush until the mosquitos and ticks ate me alive. I didn’t care, I'd become used to bugs since moving there.  

 Our neighbor’s property was totally infested with cockroaches. An exterminator told us they’d nested in our basement too. The bugs would come out at night and bite my mother and me in our sleep. Sometimes I’d find them crawling in my clothes, they were literally everywhere, so I tried spending as much time as I could outdoors.
 

I attempted building a fort in this bush in our backyard, which never came to fruition. I couldn’t find enough materials to finish the darn thing. I spent the better part of each evening searching the trails for supplies but found mostly junk. I had a bad habit of collecting everything though, everything I could find. I’d stack it in our neighbor’s yard. 


One evening I was searching the trails and found something truly magnificent. It was the best thing I’d ever discovered. I must’ve walked by it a hundred times, but had never noticed it before. It was a large seashell, a beautiful seashell, the kind you could hold up to your ear to hear the ocean. 


“Wow, look at that!” I said.

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My sister flaked on me last minute after I showed her the note and gave her a summary of what happened with the barista. Whether that makes her smart or just rude, I don&amp;#39;t know. Anyway, I ended up calling my friend Grayson instead (the one mentioned in the first post) and he seemed more than happy to accompany me to the meeting. I didn’t have class today, but I was planning on going to the campus anyway to buy a textbook that I needed. So, I got to the campus at around noon, bought the book, put it in my car, and then sat on a couch in the school student academic center and waited for Grayson. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He showed up at around 12:36. He seemed pretty joyful, considering the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Have you gotten another message from your son yet?” he asked as he dropped down onto the couch beside me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No, I haven’t” I replied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I checked the time on my phone, my palms sweating. 12:37 pm. I started to feel cold and nauseous, but I ignored it, knowing it was just the anxiety building up inside of me. I took a few deep breaths and sat next to Grayson in silence for the next few minutes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was I doing? Why was I doing this? What was I thinking? I shouldn’t have come here, I shouldn’t have agreed to this meeting in the first place. I wanted to just bail and go home. I almost did. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s 12:50, don’t you think we should start heading over to the library now?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grayson’s voice made me jump in my seat and my heart quickened with the fright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Uh, yeah. Yeah, I think we should probably get going,”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stood up and Grayson followed. We walked out of the building that we were in and began walking across the small field of grass and towards the library entrance. I stopped before we reached the automatic sliding doors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Wait,”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grayson stopped and looked at me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What? Don’t tell me that you’re having second thoughts, Jules. I woke up at eleven to get here on time and today was supposed to be my sleeping-in day,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took my phone out of my pocket and gave it to him. (I should mention that someone suggested that I do this, to make sure this thing couldn’t somehow post messages pretending to be me so good thinking &lt;a href="/u/10ladybugs"&gt;/u/10ladybugs&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why are you giving me this? Shouldn’t you keep it in case, you know, your son tries to murder you or something?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In a library full of students?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grayson sighed and took my phone, putting it in his pocket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Give me your watch,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What? Why? I &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; bought this!” he exclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You have my phone, how am I supposed to know the time?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, Grayson sighed, but he took off his watch and handed it to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Alright, let’s go,” I said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stepped into the library and the usually calm silence was eerie now, like the silence before something really bad happens in a horror film. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We walked past the front desk quietly, neither one of the librarians even glancing up at us as we made our way towards the textbook section. We walked through the maze of shelves until we ended up in the back corner of the library which contained study tables. There were a few students sitting at some of the tables, others sat a few feet away at the desktop computers. The sound of furious typing filled the silence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked down at my watch. 12:58. I looked around the library, searching for anyone who might be looking at me weird or hiding somewhere with a camera, ready to reveal to me that they had just pulled the most horrifying and complex prank of the century. Nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Maybe I should sit over there or something. I could still see you and be able to help if something went wrong, without your son knowing that you brought someone with you” Grayson whispered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I nodded and he made his way to one of the tables, picking up a random anatomy book on his way and throwing it down on the table. The loud &lt;em&gt;thud&lt;/em&gt; interrupted the silence like a gunshot and two students jumped in their chairs and then shot Grayson an ugly look. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked over to a shelf that was still in Grayson’s view and ran my hand along the smooth wood, looking around for anyone who might be approaching me. No one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked at the watch. 1:00. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where was he?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I leaned against the shelf, starting to think that this could just be some elaborate hoax. Hell, maybe even Grayson was in on it. Why else would he agree to come with me after what I told him?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ping&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked around at the sudden noise, reaching into my back pocket before realizing that it couldn’t have been my phone; Grayson had it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ping&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was coming from the computers. I walked over to the nearest one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ping&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The screen lit up white. No desktop background, no login screen, just white. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ping&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, the screen changed to some sort of chat. It looked sort of like Facebook messenger, but a knock-off version. The chat bubbles were light blue squares, almost like those on Skype. I looked at the bottom left corner and saw the three dots. Someone was typing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIT. DOWN.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No noise this time. I glanced up towards Grayson, and after making sure he still had a clear view of me, I pulled back the chair and sat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HELLO. MOM.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My fingers hovered over the keyboard for a second as I stared at new message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hi.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I typed. I looked up over the computer screen. Grayson was flipping through the textbook in front of him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHY DID YOU. BRING GRAY SUN.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked around the library. This person had to be in here...right? How else would they know I came here with someone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sorry, I was scared.&lt;/strong&gt; I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I’m going to type out the rest of this conversation- or as well as I can remember it- using ‘S’ for my “son” and &amp;#39;M&amp;#39; for myself)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;S: &lt;strong&gt;YOU SHOULD BE.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M: &lt;strong&gt;Why? Are you going to hurt me?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;S: &lt;strong&gt;YES. I AM YOUR SON.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M: &lt;strong&gt;If you are my son, why would you want to hurt me?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;S: &lt;strong&gt;YOU ARE BAD. YOU SHOULD DIE. LONG AND PAINFUL.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked up over the monitor to look at Grayson, but he was too engrossed in the stupid textbook to look up at me, and I couldn’t text him or anything because he had my phone. I was really regretting that decision. I looked around for something to throw at him so that I could catch his attention but there was nothing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;S: &lt;strong&gt;THEY CANT HELP U&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked over at the girl sitting about three chairs away from me and leaned over to tap her shoulder. She didn’t move. Didn’t even acknowledge me. I tried again. Nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;S: &lt;strong&gt;THEY DONT SEE. YOU&amp;#39;RE WITH ME. SOON FOREVER.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked around the library, a feeling of dread washing over me. &lt;em&gt;Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cleared my throat. No one turned to look at me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a deep breath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Grayson!” I whispered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He didn’t even flinch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Grayson!” I called, louder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing. Not even a “shhh” from the librarians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was not good. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got up and walked away from the computer as another message popped up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;S: &lt;strong&gt;GOODBYE MOM :)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran over to Grayson and tapped him on the shoulder. No reaction. I reached into his pocket and pulled out my phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh hey, done already?” He asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I jumped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Didn’t you hear me calling you?” I asked. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grayson shook his head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Did you find out who your son was?” He asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grabbed his sleeve and pulled him up, dragging him out of the library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hello? Jules?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ignored him as I made my way to the door. There was a security guard standing to the left. When he saw me he smiled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Leaving so soon?” He asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Your son is coming for you,” He replied, his smile getting wider as he was talking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What the fuck….” I hear Grayson whisper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Your son is coming for you,” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I turned around to see the two librarians standing behind the desk, staring at me and grinning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Your son is coming for you… your son is coming for you… your son is coming for you… your son is coming for you”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire library was now chanting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Shit. Fuck! Jules, we need to go!” Grayson grabbed my arm and dragged me out of the library and we basically ran back towards the parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone we passed on the way there stopped and stared at us, unblinking, their smiled getting wider and wider each second. Even the birds stopped moving and looked in our directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“SHIT! What the hell is this?” Grayson yelled as we passed by a group of people staring at us and smiling those same smiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My car was closer, so we both climbed inside and I backed out the lot and onto the street, nearly hitting an innocent pedestrian. I drove for a few minutes in silence, not taking my eyes off the road in front of me. After a while, I pulled over to the side of the road near a bus stop and parked the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You saw that righ-”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stopped talking when I turned to look at Grayson. He was sitting in the passenger seat, his body facing forward but his head… his head was turned as far to the left as it could go and he was staring at me. His eyes crazy and wide. And he was smiling at me, his lips pulled open in an unnatural smile, baring almost all of his teeth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Gray-Grayson?” I ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He didn’t respond, just stared at me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Your son was looking for you. But he found you now. It’s only a matter of time,” He said, barely above a whisper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, he turned his head back so that he was facing the front of the car again. I didn’t move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What the hell was that? All those people were like possessed!” Grayson exclaimed, a second later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He turned to look at me, his face normal now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What’s wrong?” He asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You. You were possessed,” I replied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What? When?” He asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Just now,”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shifted the car into drive and pulled onto the street again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What did I say?” He asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You said my son found me,” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t remember,” Grayson said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Of course you don’t, I’m sure no one on campus remembers what they did either. It’s some kind of mind control,” I replied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I drove to Grayson’s house first and dropped him off. He got out of the car and stopped to look at me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What do you think that means? That your son found you?” He asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shook my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I have no idea,”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I drove the rest of the way home in silence, no music, windows rolled up. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being followed so I turned down a few random streets for a while, making sure there wasn’t a car tailing me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got home about an hour ago, I’ve been trying to process what happened today, but I’m not any closer to figuring this thing out. Also, I can’t seem to shake the feeling that I’m being watched, no matter where I go. It’s like someone is standing behind me, everywhere I walk, but when I turn there’s no one there.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________
My sister flaked on me last minute after I showed her the note and gave her a summary of what happened with the barista. Whether that makes her smart or just rude, I don't know. Anyway, I ended up calling my friend Grayson instead (the one mentioned in the first post) and he seemed more than happy to accompany me to the meeting. I didn’t have class today, but I was planning on going to the campus anyway to buy a textbook that I needed. So, I got to the campus at around noon, bought the book, put it in my car, and then sat on a couch in the school student academic center and waited for Grayson. 


He showed up at around 12:36. He seemed pretty joyful, considering the circumstances.


“Have you gotten another message from your son yet?” he asked as he dropped down onto the couch beside me.


“No, I haven’t” I replied.


I checked the time on my phone, my palms sweating. 12:37 pm. I started to feel cold and nauseous, but I ignored it, knowing it was just the anxiety building up inside of me. I took a few deep breaths and sat next to Grayson in silence for the next few minutes. 


What was I doing? Why was I doing this? What was I thinking? I shouldn’t have come here, I shouldn’t have agreed to this meeting in the first place. I wanted to just bail and go home. I almost did. 


“It’s 12:50, don’t you think we should start heading over to the library now?”


Grayson’s voice made me jump in my seat and my heart quickened with the fright.


“Uh, yeah. Yeah, I think we should probably get going,”


I stood up and Grayson followed. We walked out of the building that we were in and began walking across the small field of grass and towards the library entrance. I stopped before we reached the automatic sliding doors.


“Wait,”


Grayson stopped and looked at me.


“What? Don’t tell me that you’re having second thoughts, Jules. I woke up at eleven to get here on time and today was supposed to be my sleeping-in day,” he said.


I took my phone out of my pocket and gave it to him. (I should mention that someone suggested that I do this, to make sure this thing couldn’t somehow post messages pretending to be me so good thinking /u/10ladybugs).


“Why are you giving me this? Shouldn’t you keep it in case, you know, your son tries to murder you or something?” he asked.


“In a library full of students?” I asked.


Grayson sighed and took my phone, putting it in his pocket.


“Give me your watch,” I said.


“What? Why? I *just* bought this!” he exclaimed.


“You have my phone, how am I supposed to know the time?” I asked.


Again, Grayson sighed, but he took off his watch and handed it to me.


“Alright, let’s go,” I said. 


We stepped into the library and the usually calm silence was eerie now, like the silence before something really bad happens in a horror film. 


We walked past the front desk quietly, neither one of the librarians even glancing up at us as we made our way towards the textbook section. We walked through the maze of shelves until we ended up in the back corner of the library which contained study tables. There were a few students sitting at some of the tables, others sat a few feet away at the desktop computers. The sound of furious typing filled the silence.


I looked down at my watch. 12:58. I looked around the library, searching for anyone who might be looking at me weird or hiding somewhere with a camera, ready to reveal to me that they had just pulled the most horrifying and complex prank of the century. Nothing.


“Maybe I should sit over there or something. I could still see you and be able to help if something went wrong, without your son knowing that you brought someone with you” Grayson whispered.


I nodded and he made his way to one of the tables, picking up a random anatomy book on his way and throwing it down on the table. The loud *thud* interrupted the silence like a gunshot and two students jumped in their chairs and then shot Grayson an ugly look. 


I walked over to a shelf that was still in Grayson’s view and ran my hand along the smooth wood, looking around for anyone who might be approaching me. No one.


I looked at the watch. 1:00. 


Where was he?


I leaned against the shelf, starting to think that this could just be some elaborate hoax. Hell, maybe even Grayson was in on it. Why else would he agree to come with me after what I told him?


*ping* 


I looked around at the sudden noise, reaching into my back pocket before realizing that it couldn’t have been my phone; Grayson had it. 


*ping*


It was coming from the computers. I walked over to the nearest one.


*ping*


The screen lit up white. No desktop background, no login screen, just white. 


*ping*


This time, the screen changed to some sort of chat. It looked sort of like Facebook messenger, but a knock-off version. The chat bubbles were light blue squares, almost like those on Skype. I looked at the bottom left corner and saw the three dots. Someone was typing.


**SIT. DOWN.**


No noise this time. I glanced up towards Grayson, and after making sure he still had a clear view of me, I pulled back the chair and sat. 


**HELLO. MOM.**


My fingers hovered over the keyboard for a second as I stared at new message.


**Hi.** 


I typed. I looked up over the computer screen. Grayson was flipping through the textbook in front of him.


**WHY DID YOU. BRING GRAY SUN.**


I looked around the library. This person had to be in here...right? How else would they know I came here with someone?


**Sorry, I was scared.** I said.


(I’m going to type out the rest of this conversation- or as well as I can remember it- using ‘S’ for my “son” and 'M' for myself)


S: **YOU SHOULD BE.**


M: **Why? Are you going to hurt me?**


S: **YES. I AM YOUR SON.**


M: **If you are my son, why would you want to hurt me?**


S: **YOU ARE BAD. YOU SHOULD DIE. LONG AND PAINFUL.**


I looked up over the monitor to look at Grayson, but he was too engrossed in the stupid textbook to look up at me, and I couldn’t text him or anything because he had my phone. I was really regretting that decision. I looked around for something to throw at him so that I could catch his attention but there was nothing. 


S: **THEY CANT HELP U**


I looked over at the girl sitting about three chairs away from me and leaned over to tap her shoulder. She didn’t move. Didn’t even acknowledge me. I tried again. Nothing.


S: **THEY DONT SEE. YOU'RE WITH ME. SOON FOREVER.**


I looked around the library, a feeling of dread washing over me. *Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.*


I cleared my throat. No one turned to look at me.


I took a deep breath.


“Grayson!” I whispered.


He didn’t even flinch.


“Grayson!” I called, louder.


Nothing. Not even a “shhh” from the librarians.


This was not good. 


I got up and walked away from the computer as another message popped up.


S: **GOODBYE MOM :)**


I ran over to Grayson and tapped him on the shoulder. No reaction. I reached into his pocket and pulled out my phone.


“Oh hey, done already?” He asked.


I jumped.


“Didn’t you hear me calling you?” I asked.

I stopped.


“What?” I asked.


“Your son is coming for you,” He replied, his smile getting wider as he was talking.


“What the fuck….” I hear Grayson whisper.


“Your son is coming for you,” 


I turned around to see the two librarians standing behind the desk, staring at me and grinning.


“Your son is coming for you… your son is coming for you… your son is coming for you… your son is coming for you”


The entire library was now chanting.

“You said my son found me,” 


“I don’t remember,” Grayson said.

&lt;p&gt;Kate popped her head in from the kitchen, holding a sprig of basil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I guess so.” Of course it’s the rain, idiot. What else do you think that &lt;em&gt;pitter-patter&lt;/em&gt; could be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I thought it was supposed to be nice out tonight.” The spoon clanked against the saucepan. “I guess we can’t eat on the patio, after all.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good. I don’t want to eat outside anyway. The Johnsons’ dog always barks at us, and his fangs are a little too big for my liking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Can you check the weather? If it’s going to let up soon, we’ll wait.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously? “Okay, honey,” I said, pulling the phone out of my pocket. My fingers tapped across the screen, and I waited for the weather page to load.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;62*F, Partly Cloudy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t say it’s raining,” I called over. “Must be a localized thing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Okay, we’ll just eat inside. It’ll be ready in a few minutes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank goodness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked into the kitchen, setting my book down on the counter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pip-pip-pip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rain drummed on outside. I took a seat at the table, and stared blankly out the glass door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I got this authentic Parmesan cheese at the grocery store last week,” she said, over the pittering rain, the clanking dishes. “It’s actually authentic Parmesan from Italy, where the cows graze on the wildflowers and…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Wait.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stared out into the darkness. The patio was dim, barely visible, in the light spilling out from the kitchen. But even so, I could tell…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t wet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“James?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrenched open the door, reached an arm outside, and felt –&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not a single drop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It isn’t raining,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No, I still hear it –”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Come outside and see for yourself,” I said, stepping out into the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When she joined me, her face dropped. “You’re right. But then… what’s making that noise?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know.” I rotated around, trying to pinpoint a direction. But the rain surrounded us, coming from every direction at once, drumming on and on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked forward, into the backyard. I half-expected the grass to be slick with rain, as if the raincloud somehow missed our house entirely; but it was dry. Kate followed me, still clutching the metal serving spoon against her body, as if to arm herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s quieter out here,” she said, her voice barely audible over the pitter-patter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What do you mean?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think – somehow – it’s coming from the house.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked back towards it, then out into the backyard again. “You’re right,” I said, pacing across the patio, frowning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What do you think it is?” she said, her voice starting to quaver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know. But think it’s loudest over here.” I walked to the left corner of the patio, against the house, next to the potted geraniums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her eyes widened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then she sprinted to the flowerpot, as fast as I’ve ever seen her go. Eyes wild, she thrust her hands into the dirt. It flew onto my shoes, onto her clothes, in cold, dark clumps –&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then she held it up – small, black, square.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My heart began to pound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A speaker?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, somewhere, a light flashed – not from the sky, but from something attached to the side of the house. Brilliant and white, across our terrified faces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a few seconds later –&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speaker rumbled with the recording of &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/ScaryBlair/"&gt;thunder.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    [selftext] => “Is that rain?”

Kate popped her head in from the kitchen, holding a sprig of basil.

“I guess so.” Of course it’s the rain, idiot. What else do you think that *pitter-patter* could be?

“I thought it was supposed to be nice out tonight.” The spoon clanked against the saucepan. “I guess we can’t eat on the patio, after all.”

Good. I don’t want to eat outside anyway. The Johnsons’ dog always barks at us, and his fangs are a little too big for my liking.

“Can you check the weather? If it’s going to let up soon, we’ll wait.”

Seriously? “Okay, honey,” I said, pulling the phone out of my pocket. My fingers tapped across the screen, and I waited for the weather page to load.

62*F, Partly Cloudy.

“It doesn’t say it’s raining,” I called over. “Must be a localized thing.”

“Okay, we’ll just eat inside. It’ll be ready in a few minutes.”

Thank goodness.

I walked into the kitchen, setting my book down on the counter.

Pip-pip-pip.

The rain drummed on outside. I took a seat at the table, and stared blankly out the glass door.

“I got this authentic Parmesan cheese at the grocery store last week,” she said, over the pittering rain, the clanking dishes. “It’s actually authentic Parmesan from Italy, where the cows graze on the wildflowers and…”

“Wait.”

I stared out into the darkness. The patio was dim, barely visible, in the light spilling out from the kitchen. But even so, I could tell…

It wasn’t wet.

“James?”

I wrenched open the door, reached an arm outside, and felt –

Nothing.

Not a single drop.

“It isn’t raining,” I said.

“No, I still hear it –”

“Come outside and see for yourself,” I said, stepping out into the darkness.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Girl found.. girl drowned... sleeping pills... bathtub... so young... tragic death... * &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;crackle* those lines are etched in my brain. They sizzle and pop inside of my ears, to the point where they may bleed.  &lt;em&gt;you deserve it&lt;/em&gt; I subconsciously tell myself.  &lt;em&gt;you let your best friend die, alone&lt;/em&gt; that voice whispers.  My head may burst.  It wasn’t my fault.  I swear it wasn’t my fault.  I didn’t contribute to her death physically. It wasn’t my fault.  * Itwasntmyitwasntmyitwasntmyfaultfaultfault*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let be back up a little.  I’m Alice.  I’m fifteen almost sixteen, and my best friend is Kate, well, was my best friend. My best friend is dead.  December 10th, 2017, Kate was found dead in her bathtub.  It was the midst of Winter Break, she has no dad, no siblings, just a workaholic mom who was too busy with taxes to ever know her daughters favourite colour.  She has a bathroom connected to her bedroom, so there was no door to it or anything, so when they found her, the water was soaking her carpet and the messy pile of clothes she never bothered to put away.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They say she didn’t suffer.  I think she did.  They’re just saying that so we can have comfort.  She struggled with depression and Insomnia. We both did.  She was in her pyjamas when she was found. She overdosed on sleeping pills and silently slipped into the tub.  She wanted to drown.  She wanted this.  &lt;em&gt;no she didn’t&lt;/em&gt; yes she did. Noyes she did. We were upset with each other at the time, since we were both really deep into our depression and we weren’t speaking to anyone for that matter.  &lt;em&gt;she was found at 3:13 am&lt;/em&gt; how do I know that? Because the last text message she sent was at that exact time. She sent me over 50. 
I was sleeping.  I was sleeping when she was suffering and ohgod she was dying and withering away while I was curled up in bed with my cat and thinking of my own problems when she was dying. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Girl found.. girl drowned... sleeping pills... bathtub... so young... tragic death... * &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her funeral was December 18th.  No one was in the Christmas spirit for the rest of the month afterwards.  I didn’t attend because I was so scared, but I did attend her wake.  The only reason why I didn’t attend was because she started messaging me and leaving me a voicemail every day.  It all started on December 15th, 5 days after she died.  She was probably in a metal box, nude, at the morgue. Alone.  As you can imagine, my depression increased.  I ate less, I slept more than usual, which was a blessing because I barely get any sleep, but also awful because she’s in my nightmares.  I remember it snowed for the first time on December 15th.  Kate loved snow.  It was probably around lunch time and I was buried under my sheets, unwilling to get out of bed and face my everyday life.  I was contemplating on calling Kate, but then I remembered that she was dead.  It was weird.  I had many moments where I forgot she had died and I was perking up at the thought of asking her to hang out until &lt;em&gt;i remember&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all began with a message.  My phone beeped. She’s the only person I really talk to, other than that, nothing but texts from family and alarms will ever make a beeping sound on my phone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;FOUR NEW MESSAGES&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kate, 1:23 pm: Bitch 
Kate, 1:23 pm: why didn’t you fucking respond when I needed u?
Kate, 1:24 pm: you fucking let me die, bitch 
Kate, 1:24 pm:  I hope you burn in hell. I’m already here, waiting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me, 1:28 pm: whoever this is, it’s not funny. Kate was my best friend. If it’s you, Blake, go fuck off. Just because she’s your ex doesn’t mean you can dick around about her death. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She didn’t respond until hours later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kate, 3:44 pm: I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry please forgive forgive me, I’m please forgive please 
Kate, 3:48 pm: why didn’t you didn’t you answer? 
Kate, 3:49 pm: I was alone I was &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me, 4:01 pm: please, leave me alone. Whoever this is, it’s not funny. Please return Kate’s phone to her parents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was freaking out. I believe in ghosts, but this was just utterly absurd. They can’t communicate via messaging, can they? No. I’m already messed up. I don’t need this bullshit to add on more stress and trauma. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kate, 4:03 pm:  I will prove to you I’m real I am real real I am &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This caught my attention. I decided to end this once and for all and ask Kate a question only she knew the answer to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me, 4:05 pm: fine. Tell me something about my body that only you’ve seen. My main flaw. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I anxiously waited. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kate, 4:07 pm: you have a small birthmark on your left hip shaped like a dove &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What. The. Fuck. She told someone??? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me, 4:10 pm: when did Kate tell you this? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kate, 4:12 pm: I am Kate I am Kate I am Kate I am Kate I am am I Kate I Kate am &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kate, 4:12 pm: You’re wearing a light grey sweatshirt with your ballet companies name on it and tight black leggings; the one with the hole in the back of the leg, and chestnut brown ugg slippers and you’ve been trying to keep your messy bun on top of your head but it’s so thick it keeps falling falling falling falling &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I threw phone across the room and it hit the wall with a &lt;em&gt;thud&lt;/em&gt;.  Why me? Why screw with me? My brain is screaming at me to not believe this bullshit, but I have a feeling, deep down in my stomach, that it’s really her. She would never lie to me. She never did. Except the fact that she swore she wouldn’t try to kill herself again after last summer’s attempt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was about to fall asleep again out of pure exhaustion and all the shit that just went down right now when my phone beeped loudly against the stained carpet next to my dresser. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kate, 4:32 pm: meet me at the park 2morrw at 7am sharp &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck, why so early? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My fingers are quivering. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me, 4:34 pm: okay. Promise you’ll show? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kate, 4:32 pm: ofc Alice Malice (; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shivered. &lt;em&gt;that was my nickname as a child when I was constantly finding trouble&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kate, 4:34 pm: no, trouble always found you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These things don&amp;#39;t care about us, they don&amp;#39;t care about our lives, to them we are just pests running around in their land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, I&amp;#39;m part of a Cryptid Task Force. We&amp;#39;re pretty well funded, and have the best gear and training money can buy. A lot of the guys here are former Tier 1 Operators from all over the world, some SAS, MARSOC, Delta, PJ, Spetsnaz, you get the idea. Our job is to be the wall that separates their world from ours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get deployed to various areas where there is a surge in cryptid activity. Number of missing  hikers or campers spiking? We get sent in. Strange sightings? We investigate. More often than not our encounters are to neutralize the threat above all else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And trust me, we&amp;#39;ve adopted a pretty simple yet catchy motto here, &amp;#39;Nothing Bullets Cannot Cure&amp;#39;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m going to be straight up, i do NOT recommend anyone to go hunting for any of these things. This isn&amp;#39;t a movie or a TV show, these things will kill you, eat you and shit you out without hesitation. You do not know how many wanna-be cryptid hunters we&amp;#39;ve had to scrape up while We&amp;#39;re dealing with a active target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also just as a side note, being in this task force doesn&amp;#39;t mean you get to encounter every single cryptid. There&amp;#39;s many I haven&amp;#39;t engaged that other teams have had the fate of dealing with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now here&amp;#39;s a little about me, spent some time in Force Recon, been around the world, seen my fair share of shit and how brutal we as a species can get, and trust me, that shit stays with you. After i did my time I decided to get into private contracting, one thing led to another and through word of mouth I ended up in this outfit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On to what i feel many of you are waiting for. 
Where I&amp;#39;m stationed at the moment, the main groups I deal with are werewolves, and stag/deer people. Lately these groups have been quiet, with the deer people being the most peaceful of the two. The werewolves, we&amp;#39;ve been able to create a set of boundaries with them. You see, the werewolves themselves when not transformed are off-the grid type of individuals. They&amp;#39;ve told us they would keep to themselves and help police their own if any try to cross the line. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately though we&amp;#39;ve hearing that they&amp;#39;ve been sightings of large bipedal creatures skulking the outskirts of towns bordering the forest. Missing persons, and even one story from a family to their local PD about how their children witnessed their father being dragged away by the &amp;quot;Dog people&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to pay the local alphas a visit, it was an 8 man team, with a platoon sized force on standby as QRF in case the proverbial shit hit the fan. We loaded up into our MRAP, and drove off into the forest. It was a quiet ride, save for the occasional story or joke being tossed around. I myself was nodding off and catching up on some extra hours of sleep before being nudged awake by the feeling of the vehicle coming to a stop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hatch opened and we all moved out and set up a perimeter. We were in front of a makeshift shanty town made out of abandoned RVs and mobile homes. As we approached them we spotted movement through one of the windows, our CO told us to stand down and walked forward with his hands up, he only took ten steps before a man built like Arnold Schwarzenegger from Predator stepped out from one of the mobile homes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hairs on the back of my neck stood up, and my grip on my weapon tightened. The air was filled with tension as we watched as our commanding officer looked up at this giant; then laugh. The man laughed as well and they embraced each-other with a firm handshake, with an audible, &amp;quot;How have you been you bastard&amp;quot; being heard. I relaxed a bit, as did the rest of the team. The man, beckoned us all closer, with our CO nodding that it was all clear. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found out that apparently there has been a pack of younger werewolves running about, causing havoc and disturbing the peace of the general area and trying to gain strength, which connects them to string of missing individuals. We reported back to base, and we along with three other teams were tasked with a SAR op deep into the pack&amp;#39;s territory. Our secondary objective was to subdue or neutralize the younger pack. To be honest i was hoping to talk these guys down, but knowing that this pack was filled with hot heads trying to make a name for themselves as the new big bad on the block, I doubt we were going to be able to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 1745 Hours we moved out, pushing past the boundaries placed by the treaty some years ago. It was unnerving to say the least, don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, we are all solid guys, each seeing our share of chaos and brutality that would swallow the soul of a regular individual; But this, this wasn&amp;#39;t storming an insurgent stronghold or securing a VIP. One wrong move and the entire op could go tits up and alot of good men would die. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s when our vehicle got hit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MRAPs are designed to take IEDs like a champ and keep rolling until the occupants are out the killzone. But I don&amp;#39;t think they accounted for the factor of nearly 300 pounds of pure muscle slamming into it at 35 to 50 miles per hour. It sent our vehicle tumbling onto its side, and me hanging on for dear life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the initial daze of recovering from the impact, I heard the metal on the back door straining then saw it come flying right off. The beast then peaked its head in and eyed all of us, as if picking from a large buffet table, its bright yellow eyes locked onto mine and i froze, i couldn&amp;#39;t bring my weapon up, nor could i call out. All i could do is lay there as this hulking monstrosity reached for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gunfire rang out, and i saw the impact of three rounds into its lower abdomen. It howled and stumbled back, our CO had his side arm out and he pumped the last 7 rounds into its upper chest and face. It fell onto the dirt road, writhing in pain, smoke visibly coming out of the entry points. Fun fact, our rounds are silver tipped, and for our side arms silver tipped hollow points filled with holy ash. We exited the vehicle and watched as our commander, I&amp;#39;ll call him &amp;#39;Konrad&amp;#39; dispatch the bastard with two rounds from his rifle to the dome. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s when the gunfire started ringing out in the distance, and the howls; the radio in the MRAP came to life, with a frantic voice on the net: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This is wolfpack 3-6 to Apache flight, confirm call-sign&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wolfpack 3-6 this is Black Raven over.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Solid copy Black Raven, request air support at these coordinates! All Units in the area! Message follows, &amp;#39;Nirvana&amp;#39;! I say again! &amp;#39;Nirvana!&amp;#39; Dammit Black Raven we need support!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Copy that coming in hot!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;They&amp;#39;re closing!! Oh God! Oh God! Jesus Christ! Oh SH--!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gunfire reached a crescendo, only to be drowned out by the sound of a hellfire impacting the area. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sat there in stunned silence, looking at one another before Konrad interjected, &amp;quot;Zweihänder this is Hunter actual. All bodies accounted for, we are still Oscar Mike to objective, how copy?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Zweihänder to Hunter actual, solid copy on all, be advised Wolfpack is down, rendezvous with Eagle and Dragoon 3 clicks from your position.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Solid Copy Zweihänder, Hunter actual out.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Konrad looked at us all, &amp;quot;Keep your head on a swivel boys, we&amp;#39;re in their country now...&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say the hellfire probably helped our rendezvous with Eagle and Dragoon more than anything. After grouping up into a sizeable force we pushed forward, locating the lair of the pack. They were holed up in a cave with makeshift barricades around the entrance. We set up positions around it, our COs drawing up a plan to neutralize the hostiles and hopefully save any of the missing people taken over the past week, if they weren&amp;#39;t turned. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s when we saw some one walk out, he looked no older than 19, but he walked as if he was better than us. He stood at the entrance, with several others coming up behind him, he called out to us, &amp;quot;Alright! We know why you&amp;#39;re here, and trust me, you don&amp;#39;t want to fuck with us. We can take all of you out easily, there are more of us than you in here. Too many bodies for your bullets!&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As per protocol our retort was for him and his compatriots to stand down, come in for questioning and judgement by the elder alphas and to release anyone they held captive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The look on the kid&amp;#39;s face was one of disgust and contempt, as if we bruised his ego. He flipped us off, and crouched down on all fours and began to transform. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fucking idiot, i thought. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before he could even finish a shot rang out, a silver tipped 7.62x51mm round impacted his forehead, splitting it like a melon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The silence that followed was unnerving, the other individuals looked at his body, then at us, and dropped to their knees, hands in the air. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Konrad looked at me, motioning for me and several others to move in, secure and search the compound. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got up and moved, my rifle leveled and ready, moving swiftly towards them, Heel to toe, Heel to toe. I got a good look at them, all kids, some were crying, others were shocked into silence as we zip-tied them. After they were secured we moved into the cave itself, I tossed a flare in, shouting out, &amp;quot;CRT! Anyone in here?!&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got a response, albeit a weak one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We moved to the sound and found our missing individuals, all eight of them, five males, three females, all obviously shook up and in need of aid. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We moved them out onto waiting MRAPs heading back to base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what we gathered we killed the head honcho of the pack, and their strongest members were taken out by the hellfire. The survivors we questioned all said that the kidnapped individuals were set to be turned and added to their numbers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recovered the bodies of Wolfpack, and gave them the burial they deserved. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all i can say for now, I gotta go, we got reports of something big happening and command needs all hands on deck. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take care,
All of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and remember&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing Bullets Cannot Cure &lt;/p&gt;

From what we gathered we killed the head honcho of the pack, and their strongest members were taken out by the hellfire. The survivors we questioned all said that the kidnapped individuals were set to be turned and added to their numbers. 

We recovered the bodies of Wolfpack, and gave them the burial they deserved. 


That's all i can say for now, I gotta go, we got reports of something big happening and command needs all hands on deck. 

Take care,
All of you.

and remember

Nothing Bullets Cannot Cure

                    [selftext_html] => &lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have meditated everyday for the last 5 years. It started out as a stress reliever. I did nothing but work and raise my children. I had no hobbies and very few friends, so when something would go wrong, I had no constructive way to vent it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anger and stress was building up all my life. I&amp;#39;ve always been pretty guarded when it  comes to my emotions, but in 2013, I finally hit a breaking point.  I had just filed for divorce from my wife, my dog of twelve years passed away in his sleep and my 14 year old son, Tyler, was expelled from every public school in our area for bullying other children. My average 24 hours consisted of meeting with my lawyer to work on getting sole custody, interviewing at private schools for my son, working 14 hour nightshifts at a can factory in Vancouver, Canada and sleeping 3 to 5 hours. Rinse and repeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funny thing about stress, deep, unrelenting stress, is you never know what&amp;#39;s going to put you over the edge. For me, it was traffic. I was on my way home from work at about six in the morning, when a large pickup truck sped up behind me and rode my ass for 5 kilometers. He finally passed me, then slowed right down, applying the breaks every few meters. I tried to keep my cool, assholes will be assholes after all, but I was already seeing red. His brake lights flashing on are the last thing I remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I came to, I was in the back of an ambulance. A young paramedic was sitting beside me, taking my blood pressure. Apparently, I had rear ended the pickup truck. He had spun out and rolled 4 or 5 times down a steep embankment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Was the driver all right?&amp;quot; I had asked.
The paramedic looked at me blankly.
&amp;quot;I already told you. He died before the firemen could get him out.&amp;quot;
I felt sick to my stomach. Was I going to jail for this? I had blacked out in a fit of rage and had gotten somebody killed. As it turned out, there were no eye witnesses, and the driver had been drinking heavily. They had concluded that I was blameless, and carried on with their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I knew I was guilty. Deep down, I knew what I had done, even if I couldn&amp;#39;t remember it. There was no way I could ever let something like that happen again. I have kids who need me, I couldn&amp;#39;t get myself killed or arrested. If I blacked out like that again, I doubted I would make it out alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I turned to meditation. It worked quite well, for the most part. I would turn on a Nature Sounds CD every morning and every evening, clear my head and focus on my breathing. Somewhere deep within, I could still feel a knot of tension, some untouchable anger, but I was doing pretty well overall, so I didn&amp;#39;t worry about it. Regular meditation not only helped my moods, but it helped my focus. Over those five years, I won sole custody from my pain pill addicted ex-wife, I started a successful online business, I got my son a job with my company after he graduated high school and I actually had time to attend my daughter&amp;#39;s dance recitals and soccer games. I didn&amp;#39;t even think about the accident anymore. But the good days never last. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My son Tyler was found overdosed in the bathroom of a nightclub about 4 weeks ago. He went to a concert with his friends on New year&amp;#39;s Eve, and they bought some cocaine from some random drug dealer on the street outside. I don&amp;#39;t know if this was the first time Tyler had tried drugs. But I do know it was the last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tyler passed away on the way to the hospital. Apparently the drugs Tyler ingested were laced with carfentanyl, an incredibly potent and addictive painkiller. The dealers cut it into the coke to try to drum up repeat business. Once you&amp;#39;re addicted to the fentanyl, normal cocaine just won&amp;#39;t do it for you, so you&amp;#39;ll have to go back to them for more. The flaw in their logic lies in the fact that a single grain of the stuff can kill you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t sad when I got the call. I wasn&amp;#39;t angry. I wasn&amp;#39;t anything at all. I vaguely remember closing my eyes and trying to focus on my breathing, but I was slipping away too fast. I could feel the walls closing in. The world was turning red behind my eyelids. The last thing I remember, my daughter was shaking my arm, asking what had happened. That was a month ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I finally came back two days ago, I was laying down in the back of a van, covered in blood. Somebody was knocking on the back door. There was a dead body next to me. His face was deep purple, it looked as if he&amp;#39;d been strangled to death. 
Did I do this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have any idea how disconcerting it is, to wake up at an unknown time, in an unknown place, with no recollection of how you ended up there? I looked around at the carnage. There was a pool of blood leaking under the door to the front cab. There was no way I could open the backdoor of this presumably stolen vehicle, covered in blood, and hope to explain myself to whoever was out there. I opened the connecting door into the front seat and saw a large man in a leather vest buckled up in the passenger seat with his throat slit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I froze for a moment, and then as if guided by some internal force, I got to work. I unbuckled him and dragged his body into the back of the van. The windows were heavily tinted, so I assumed that regardless of how long I&amp;#39;d been there, nobody had seen the corpse in the front seat. I fished the car keys out of the pocket of the strangled man. I covered both bodies with a tarp that was tucked in a corner, and moved to peer out the back window. Through the heavy tint, I spotted another man in a leather vest. He must have caught a glimpse of movement in the window, because he started yelling something, and backed away. A couple more people walked up to join him. I noticed that these men had guns. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heard the glass smash behind me as I moved back into the front of the van. I put the keys in the ignition and tried to start it, but apparently the battery was dead. However, I was parked on a very steep incline, so I threw it in neutral and kicked off the emergency brake. I heard some shouts from the back of the van as we started careening down a hill. I tried to steer as best as I could. It&amp;#39;s really difficult without power steering. I felt a hand grab my shoulder but I wasn&amp;#39;t willing to take my eyes off the road to deal with it. The van must have been going 80 km an hour at this point. I heard a gun cock behind me. I put on my seat belt and crashed the van head-on into a cement median. A body flew straight past me, through the windshield. The gun misfired and ricocheted around the enclosed back area. I heard a scream of pain and then I blacked out again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the paramedics arrived, they found 5 dead men in that van. One man&amp;#39;s throat had been slit. The presumed passenger had been thrown through the windshield and had died on impact. The third man had been shot in the abdomen and bled to death. The fourth man appears to have been strangled. These four were identified as members of a gang. A gang who&amp;#39;s primary racket was the distribution and import of cocaine throughout the western provinces. 10 kilograms of cocaine were recovered from the van. Most of the drug was found to have been cut with carfentanyl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fifth man was dressed differently, and is as of right now unidentified. The knife and the gun were found on him, as well as a suicide note. He had minor injuries from the crash and a self inflicted gunshot wound to the head. An eyewitness reported a sixth man wearing a leather vest fleeing the scene&amp;quot; Please report any information to Red Deer Crime Stoppers at...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read all of that in the Red Deer Advocate newspaper this morning. I woke up around 10am, wearing clothes that weren&amp;#39;t mine...  Did I clean up the crime scene? What exactly happens to me when I blackout? I clearly wasn&amp;#39;t unconcious. I woke up in a hotel 15km away from where the van crashed. How did I get here? I am 1200km away from my home, wanted in connection with the murder of five people. Please tell me, dear reader, what the fuck do I do now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no siblings, and my real mother and father have long since departed, lost to the treachery of an icy road, many years ago. Mother... Father... when I think of them, my heart should light up with the flickering warmth of joyous memories. How I loved them, yet, when I visit their grave each year, and I look upon the cold grey stone that bares their name, memories of two others corrupt my cherished recollections... two strangers... who called themselves, &amp;#39;Mom and Pop.&amp;#39; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve fought my whole life to erase their pale faces from my mind, but now I know I must risk everything to return to my old childhood home, to rid myself of them, once and for all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you must understand that &amp;#39;Mom and Pop&amp;#39;, these... watchers... were not my parents. Even saying their name conjures the worst images imaginable. Looking out the windscreen of my car, I can see the fateful red sky before me, impatient to devour me. Tonight, I must drive fast, to reach my old childhood home before nightfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the road races under the wheels of my car, a can of petrol jostles loudly in the trunk. Tonight our journey will end with fire, but first I must tell you how it began. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was seven years old we lived in the suburbs of a small factory town. Our home was the full package; white picket fence, two storeys and four bedrooms - a perfect home with a perfect middle-class family inside, or should I say, trapped inside. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My father was an administrator at the factory, a job he hated but couldn&amp;#39;t afford to quit. This unhappiness caused many arguments between my parents, during which I&amp;#39;d hide in my bedroom upstairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I consoled myself with toys, recreating scenes from movies, with police cars whizzing in hot pursuit of some villain, or fighting great wars among the ranks of my plastic soldiers. Despite my attempts at escapism, I remained a sorrowful child, with a constant feeling of loneliness, both at home and school. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One Sunday afternoon, it was raining hard, and my parents were fighting, again. I suddenly couldn&amp;#39;t take it any longer. I dropped my toys, fell to the floor and cried my eyes out. A feminine sigh, gentle and sympathetic, surprised me. I had thought I was alone. I turned around, and was startled by the sight before me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blurred through my tears, I could see two figures, standing, watching me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the moment when you&amp;#39;ll think I&amp;#39;m mad, when you might stop listening. But I&amp;#39;m sure of what I saw; a beautiful looking woman, dressed in 1950&amp;#39;s attire with a smile so infectious that I couldn&amp;#39;t resist smiling back, frightened though I was. Next to her stood a man in a blue-blazer and slacks, his collar adorned with a bow-tie, who smiled with the same wide-eyed delight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They resembled the couples you&amp;#39;d see in adverts for new kitchens in old magazines, and perhaps like the pages of those magazines, they possessed a slightly uncanny two dimensional form. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t remember the precise words they said, as they spoke in a quick murmur that seemed to translate itself inside my head. I only recall that they wanted me to call them, &amp;#39;Mom and Pop.&amp;#39; Strange as it may seem, with them I experienced a level of euphoria and security I&amp;#39;d never known before. Whatever utterances they made echoed inside me, filling me with a sense of love that would send me to asleep excited at the prospect of seeing them again the next day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the days and weeks that followed, I soon trusted my &amp;#39;new parents&amp;#39; to be there for me, more than my actual mother and father. After dinner, I would race up upstairs to be with them, so I could hear Pop&amp;#39;s adventure tales, or better yet, so Mom could tuck me into bed and read me bedtime stories, all while my real parents shouted at one another downstairs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing, not the bullies that plagued me or my parent&amp;#39;s constant arguing, could discourage my new found joy. Every evening when I returned from school, Mom and Pop would be waiting, waving cheerfully from my bedroom window, with smiles that never faded. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until the night they did. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One bedtime, as &amp;#39;Mom&amp;#39; tucked me in as usual, she seemed distracted, like someone is when they have a secret they&amp;#39;re desperate to share. That night I had a terrible dream, a nightmare in fact, that saw me lost and alone in a great void. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could see only a black horizon without end, and such was the terror I felt at this that I awoke. It was still night time, and it took me a moment for my eyes to adjust to the darkness. At the foot of my bed I could see shapes, first one and then another. I slowly made out their features, and with some fear I recognised that it was Mom and Pop, standing at the end of the bed, watching me.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did they watch me this way every night? Mom and Pop saw that I was awake, and glided towards me. Leaning in close, they explained that they had spent all night coming to an important decision about the future of our &amp;#39;family.&amp;#39; They asked, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Do you want to be with us forever?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The street light outside glowed orange, painting their faces with warmth. Their kind eyes shimmered with emotion. How could I refuse? I was a mere outcast at school, a lonely boy without a friend in the world, and here I was, with the two most wonderful people I knew. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t remember the exact words they said, but I can remember mine, and I can still hear my seven year old self fatefully whispering &amp;#39;yes...&amp;#39; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I blacked out, and what happened next is a blur. From what I was told, it seems my parents were roused from their sleep by the sound of me rummaging in the kitchen. When they came to investigate, they were shocked to discover me lying on the floor, attempting to force the prongs of a fork into an electrical wall socket. I have no memory of this, but I remember how upset  my parents were and how scared I was when they explained how close I had been to killing myself.  They didn&amp;#39;t want to leave me alone that night, so they took me to bed with them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As my mother and father hugged and embraced me, I could only think of my bedroom just down the hall, where I considered with dread who would be waiting there at the foot of my bed. I need not have worried, because in the days that followed I did not see Mom and Pop again, neither at the foot of my bed or at my bedroom window as I left for school. This was a golden time for me, and at school I even began making friends, while my parents reconciled the issues that had put their marriage in jeopardy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one night in October, in the midst of a gale, I awoke to find Mom standing by my bed, concealed in shadow, but for the moment a flash of lightning illuminated her. She didn&amp;#39;t speak, but just watched me with eyes that burrowed into mine. She was smiling as always, but I realised that it was never really a smile. It twisted strangely at the corners. It was a crude mask that hid a grin filled with malicious intent. Enraged by my rejection, I could see that Mom was now relishing the prospect of whatever she had in store for me. Trembling in horror, I thrust myself under the bed sheets, terrified of what might come next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second bolt of lighting revealed Pop, who stood by the window, now wide open. Wind blasted in, lifting the curtains over the rails, spraying a torrent of rainwater across the room. The fury of the storm was overwhelming, but not for Mom and Pop, who stood there, unaffected by the wind, not a hair blown out of place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I peered out from under the bed covers at the open window across the room, Pop was there, beckoning me towards it, his thin fingers bending unnaturally towards the fate they had in store for me. It was clear what he wanted me to do, to leap out the second storey window to my death. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I would be with them forever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God knows I tried to scream, but the very air had been crushed out of my lungs, lost to the terror that gripped me. I looked to Mom, perhaps hoping for mercy, but her eyes, once so radiant with love, now twinkled like those of a demented madman. I could take it no longer and shook my head, whispering with what little defiance I could muster, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No... no, Mom... Pop... I can&amp;#39;t.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will never forget what happened next. Mom switched like a slide in a projector into a horror beyond imagination. She glided towards me, her eyes draining of colour, her jaw unhinging to reveal a cavernous black hole which emitted a shriek so terrifying that I covered my ears and dived back under the sheets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the thin fabric I could see them, illuminated by flashes of lightning as they circled my bed, before standing together at the foot of my bed, watching me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commotion had alerted my father, who burst into the room, rushed straight to the window and slammed it shut. Close behind was mother, who scooped me out of bed and rushed me downstairs. They had not seen Mom and Pop, who vanished the second my parents entered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought these events had taken minutes, but it seems I had been exposed to the elements for hours.  I was freezing cold, probably in shock. My father ran a hot bath, while my mother prepared me a mug of hot chocolate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was so out of it that I was almost catatonic. I remember mother blowing on my hot chocolate to help cool it down, and then giving me small sips, so not to burn me. She stroked my hair, and was so attentive and loving, but even with her, I thought she could change suddenly like Mom had. Perhaps this was a trick and they were just pretending to be my real parents? To feel so paranoid about the only ones you have left is the loneliest feeling in the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the bath was ready, father carried me upstairs, gently lowering me into the warm water. The heat of it came as a shock to my ice cold bones. As steam filled the room, a sense of relief set in, or perhaps it was exhaustion. In the soothing water I felt I could sleep for a hundred years. They left the bathroom door half-open, and I drew great comfort from the sound of their voices, even though they were discussing whether to call out the doctor. My behaviour must have frightened them deeply. They must have wondered what had gone wrong with their boy. I wondered too, what it was that I had done to deserve this, and why &amp;#39;Mom and Pop&amp;#39; had chosen me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while, the humidity of the bathroom produced enough haze to obscure the door, which, after a time, I noticed was closed. I could still hear my parents outside, but then the sound of their voices too became faint, replaced eventually by silence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our bathroom was small and narrow with tiled walls. The tiles were decorated with nautical pictures; ships and fish, now obscured by the enveloping haze. The pictures, obscured as they were, appeared to change, and to the left and right of me were pictures of people, one on the left wall and the other on my right. Ships? No, and not sailors either. I recognised the face of Mom staring at me from the wall. Pop was on my right, both of them attached to the walls like wallpaper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The white pupils of their grey eyes were fixed squarely on mine, their expressionless faces bereft of humanity. Their skin and clothes were grey, drained of almost all their colour. Before I could scream, Mom began to peel down the wall, her body curling until her head was upside down, her eyes never leaving me. Their necks stretched out, unnaturally long, as their faces leant closer and closer towards my own, their white eyes glowing like lost stars. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I screamed, thrashing my arms and legs with all my might. My parents heard the noise and rushed to get into the bathroom, but found the door locked, latched shut from the inside. As they fought to smash their way in, another force was pinning my head under the bathwater. I can remember shrieking as the water flooded my lungs, and my eyes burning as I fought to keep them open. Distorted by the rippling water, I could see their pale faces watching me die. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were smiling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The door collapsed from its hinges, and my father dragged me out of the bath. I kicked and screamed, and no matter which room my parents took me to, all I could see when I opened my eyes,  were Mom and Pop staring at me... just inches away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I waited for the doctor, I refused to open my eyes. Even then, I could still feel their presence close by, the prickling sensation of their breath on the nape of my neck. When the doctor arrived, I was whisked away to a local clinic where I received a psychological evaluation. I tried my best to explain what had happened, but how does a seven year old articulate a phenomena such as this? My story was inevitably misinterpreted and I was soon placed into Protective Social Care, during which time I stayed with a number of foster parents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw many therapists who placed me on drugs that no child should endure, until, finally, after a year, I was returned to my parents. By this time, they had moved out of town, after many in the local community suspected them of abusing me, whether spoken publicly or revealed by a judgemental look. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I enjoyed a thoroughly ordinary adolescence, and I grew up with the usual fixations on video arcades and girls. During this time, I had come to believe that Mom and Pop were not real, but the manifestation of a breakdown brought about by the stress of my parents&amp;#39; marital problems, and our move to a new town. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seemed reasonable to assume this, not only because my memories of childhood were so clouded, but because so much of it was unfathomably surreal. The white faces that haunted me became as vague as a startling scene one might recall from a horror movie they&amp;#39;d watched years ago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, I was so sceptical that I was quite unconcerned when, during a road trip with friends, we passed through my old home town. I hadn&amp;#39;t seen it since I was a child, and while I might have felt some trepidation, I was mostly curious about which diners were still open, and spared little thought for the monsters I&amp;#39;d consigned to childhood delusion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We passed through the main street around dusk, and made it to the suburbs close to my former home shortly after. The years had not been kind to the town, which had experienced some hard times since the closure of the factory. Those aspirational, middle class homes once adorned with clean white picket fences, were now half empty, with many sporting protective bars on their windows. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw my old home loom towards us on the road. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strange instinct wanted me to stop, to make my friend turn the car around, but I fought it, after all, what did I have to fear now? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I asked my friend to slow down, and the car crawled along the kerb past my former home. The place looked decrepit, its rooms now empty, with most windows broken and boarded up. It looked so tragic in fact, that it looked almost disappointingly harmless, as if I had misspent my time mythologising whatever had occurred there in my childhood. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gave a sudden laugh, which surprised even myself. My friend grinned at me as he switched on the car radio and speeded up. As the music played, I smiled at the wing mirror, at the sight of my old home shrinking fast behind us. I felt on top of the world, and decided to turn around to give the place one last look before it vanished for good. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No... it couldn&amp;#39;t be.... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two shapes, silhouetted by the sun, stood at my old bedroom window. I couldn&amp;#39;t make out the shapes, but they looked like people. I could feel my stomach plummet with dread as I recalled &amp;#39;Mom and Pop&amp;#39;. Back then, I had even forgotten what I used to call them. As our car turned at the end of the street, I struggled to fight the nausea rising fast within me. My friend offered to stop the car, concerned that I might be sick but I shouted at him, begged him in fact, to keep driving at all costs.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He must have thought I was crazy, and I probably was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the years rolled by, I became fixated with what I&amp;#39;d seen that day. Was it two figures by the window or perhaps a trick of the light? Then, in a perverse irony, it was not Mom and Pop, whether real or not, that ended up ruining my life. I managed that all by myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After college, I pursued a normal life, anything that would prevent me being alone with my thoughts and fears, anything to prevent my loneliness. I settled down with the first woman who would marry me, rushed her to have kids, the works. I worked a normal job, a low level white collar position at a local manufacturer. I ended up hating my job, hating my wife, hating everything, but I couldn&amp;#39;t leave them for fear of being alone with myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I was fired when the economy went South, after which I fell into a spell of heavy drinking. My wife did her best to help, but in the end, nobody could save me. She left, taking the kids with her to live on the West Coast, hundreds of miles from me. I&amp;#39;m glad she did, for their sake and her own. Not long after my marriage fell apart, my parents passed away in a tragic road accident. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was truly alone, and I felt just as lonely as I had when I was a nervous kid hiding upstairs in my room while my parents argued downstairs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One night, after a bout of heavy drinking, I made a pitiful and devastating realisation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a lost cause, perhaps I&amp;#39;d always been, and yet nobody took away the pain of loneliness like Mom and Pop. In my unexceptional life that had amounted to nothing but tedious mediocrity, only they were truly exceptional, and, remarkable though they were, they&amp;#39;d chosen me. I&amp;#39;m ignored by the world, and yet, they were the ones to find something special and worthwhile in me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mom and Pop... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the red sky is black, and as my car rolls up to the front of my old childhood home, I know now what I must do, what I wasn&amp;#39;t brave enough to do as a child. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I step out of the car and look upon the derelict building before me. My old home is condemned for demolition, much like the rest of my abandoned home town. I take the can of petrol from the boot of my car, and look up to my old bedroom window. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t see them yet, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/7YitHSVgTfY"&gt;but I know they&amp;#39;ll be waiting.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/7YitHSVgTfY"&gt;https://youtu.be/7YitHSVgTfY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But one night in October, in the midst of a gale, I awoke to find Mom standing by my bed, concealed in shadow, but for the moment a flash of lightning illuminated her. She didn't speak, but just watched me with eyes that burrowed into mine. She was smiling as always, but I realised that it was never really a smile. It twisted strangely at the corners. It was a crude mask that hid a grin filled with malicious intent. Enraged by my rejection, I could see that Mom was now relishing the prospect of whatever she had in store for me. Trembling in horror, I thrust myself under the bed sheets, terrified of what might come next.

A second bolt of lighting revealed Pop, who stood by the window, now wide open. Wind blasted in, lifting the curtains over the rails, spraying a torrent of rainwater across the room. The fury of the storm was overwhelming, but not for Mom and Pop, who stood there, unaffected by the wind, not a hair blown out of place. 

I peered out from under the bed covers at the open window across the room, Pop was there, beckoning me towards it, his thin fingers bending unnaturally towards the fate they had in store for me. It was clear what he wanted me to do, to leap out the second storey window to my death. 

Then I would be with them forever. 

God knows I tried to scream, but the very air had been crushed out of my lungs, lost to the terror that gripped me. I looked to Mom, perhaps hoping for mercy, but her eyes, once so radiant with love, now twinkled like those of a demented madman. I could take it no longer and shook my head, whispering with what little defiance I could muster, 

“No... no, Mom... Pop... I can't.”

I will never forget what happened next. Mom switched like a slide in a projector into a horror beyond imagination. She glided towards me, her eyes draining of colour, her jaw unhinging to reveal a cavernous black hole which emitted a shriek so terrifying that I covered my ears and dived back under the sheets. 

Through the thin fabric I could see them, illuminated by flashes of lightning as they circled my bed, before standing together at the foot of my bed, watching me. 

The commotion had alerted my father, who burst into the room, rushed straight to the window and slammed it shut. Close behind was mother, who scooped me out of bed and rushed me downstairs. They had not seen Mom and Pop, who vanished the second my parents entered. 

I thought these events had taken minutes, but it seems I had been exposed to the elements for hours.  I was freezing cold, probably in shock. My father ran a hot bath, while my mother prepared me a mug of hot chocolate. 

I was so out of it that I was almost catatonic. I remember mother blowing on my hot chocolate to help cool it down, and then giving me small sips, so not to burn me. She stroked my hair, and was so attentive and loving, but even with her, I thought she could change suddenly like Mom had. Perhaps this was a trick and they were just pretending to be my real parents? To feel so paranoid about the only ones you have left is the loneliest feeling in the world. 

Once the bath was ready, father carried me upstairs, gently lowering me into the warm water. The heat of it came as a shock to my ice cold bones. As steam filled the room, a sense of relief set in, or perhaps it was exhaustion. In the soothing water I felt I could sleep for a hundred years. They left the bathroom door half-open, and I drew great comfort from the sound of their voices, even though they were discussing whether to call out the doctor. My behaviour must have frightened them deeply. They must have wondered what had gone wrong with their boy. I wondered too, what it was that I had done to deserve this, and why 'Mom and Pop' had chosen me. 

After a while, the humidity of the bathroom produced enough haze to obscure the door, which, after a time, I noticed was closed. I could still hear my parents outside, but then the sound of their voices too became faint, replaced eventually by silence. 

Our bathroom was small and narrow with tiled walls. The tiles were decorated with nautical pictures; ships and fish, now obscured by the enveloping haze. The pictures, obscured as they were, appeared to change, and to the left and right of me were pictures of people, one on the left wall and the other on my right. Ships? No, and not sailors either. I recognised the face of Mom staring at me from the wall. Pop was on my right, both of them attached to the walls like wallpaper. 

The white pupils of their grey eyes were fixed squarely on mine, their expressionless faces bereft of humanity. Their skin and clothes were grey, drained of almost all their colour. Before I could scream, Mom began to peel down the wall, her body curling until her head was upside down, her eyes never leaving me. Their necks stretched out, unnaturally long, as their faces leant closer and closer towards my own, their white eyes glowing like lost stars. 

I screamed, thrashing my arms and legs with all my might. My parents heard the noise and rushed to get into the bathroom, but found the door locked, latched shut from the inside. As they fought to smash their way in, another force was pinning my head under the bathwater. I can remember shrieking as the water flooded my lungs, and my eyes burning as I fought to keep them open. Distorted by the rippling water, I could see their pale faces watching me die. 

They were smiling. 

The door collapsed from its hinges, and my father dragged me out of the bath. I kicked and screamed, and no matter which room my parents took me to, all I could see when I opened my eyes,  were Mom and Pop staring at me... just inches away. 

As I waited for the doctor, I refused to open my eyes. Even then, I could still feel their presence close by, the prickling sensation of their breath on the nape of my neck. When the doctor arrived, I was whisked away to a local clinic where I received a psychological evaluation. I tried my best to explain what had happened, but how does a seven year old articulate a phenomena such as this? My story was inevitably misinterpreted and I was soon placed into Protective Social Care, during which time I stayed with a number of foster parents. 

I saw many therapists who placed me on drugs that no child should endure, until, finally, after a year, I was returned to my parents. By this time, they had moved out of town, after many in the local community suspected them of abusing me, whether spoken publicly or revealed by a judgemental look. 

Fortunately, I enjoyed a thoroughly ordinary adolescence, and I grew up with the usual fixations on video arcades and girls. During this time, I had come to believe that Mom and Pop were not real, but the manifestation of a breakdown brought about by the stress of my parents' marital problems, and our move to a new town. 

It seemed reasonable to assume this, not only because my memories of childhood were so clouded, but because so much of it was unfathomably surreal. The white faces that haunted me became as vague as a startling scene one might recall from a horror movie they'd watched years ago. 

In fact, I was so sceptical that I was quite unconcerned when, during a road trip with friends, we passed through my old home town. I hadn't seen it since I was a child, and while I might have felt some trepidation, I was mostly curious about which diners were still open, and spared little thought for the monsters I'd consigned to childhood delusion. 

We passed through the main street around dusk, and made it to the suburbs close to my former home shortly after. The years had not been kind to the town, which had experienced some hard times since the closure of the factory. Those aspirational, middle class homes once adorned with clean white picket fences, were now half empty, with many sporting protective bars on their windows. 

I saw my old home loom towards us on the road. 

A strange instinct wanted me to stop, to make my friend turn the car around, but I fought it, after all, what did I have to fear now? 

Instead, I asked my friend to slow down, and the car crawled along the kerb past my former home. The place looked decrepit, its rooms now empty, with most windows broken and boarded up. It looked so tragic in fact, that it looked almost disappointingly harmless, as if I had misspent my time mythologising whatever had occurred there in my childhood. 

I gave a sudden laugh, which surprised even myself. My friend grinned at me as he switched on the car radio and speeded up. As the music played, I smiled at the wing mirror, at the sight of my old home shrinking fast behind us. I felt on top of the world, and decided to turn around to give the place one last look before it vanished for good. 

No... it couldn't be.... 

Two shapes, silhouetted by the sun, stood at my old bedroom window. I couldn't make out the shapes, but they looked like people. I could feel my stomach plummet with dread as I recalled 'Mom and Pop'. Back then, I had even forgotten what I used to call them. As our car turned at the end of the street, I struggled to fight the nausea rising fast within me. My friend offered to stop the car, concerned that I might be sick but I shouted at him, begged him in fact, to keep driving at all costs.  

He must have thought I was crazy, and I probably was.

As the years rolled by, I became fixated with what I'd seen that day. Was it two figures by the window or perhaps a trick of the light? Then, in a perverse irony, it was not Mom and Pop, whether real or not, that ended up ruining my life. I managed that all by myself.

After college, I pursued a normal life, anything that would prevent me being alone with my thoughts and fears, anything to prevent my loneliness. I settled down with the first woman who would marry me, rushed her to have kids, the works. I worked a normal job, a low level white collar position at a local manufacturer. I ended up hating my job, hating my wife, hating everything, but I couldn't leave them for fear of being alone with myself. 

Eventually, I was fired when the economy went South, after which I fell into a spell of heavy drinking. My wife did her best to help, but in the end, nobody could save me. She left, taking the kids with her to live on the West Coast, hundreds of miles from me. I'm glad she did, for their sake and her own. Not long after my marriage fell apart, my parents passed away in a tragic road accident. 

I was truly alone, and I felt just as lonely as I had when I was a nervous kid hiding upstairs in my room while my parents argued downstairs. 

One night, after a bout of heavy drinking, I made a pitiful and devastating realisation. 

I was a lost cause, perhaps I'd always been, and yet nobody took away the pain of loneliness like Mom and Pop. In my unexceptional life that had amounted to nothing but tedious mediocrity, only they were truly exceptional, and, remarkable though they were, they'd chosen me. I'm ignored by the world, and yet, they were the ones to find something special and worthwhile in me. 

Mom and Pop... 

Now the red sky is black, and as my car rolls up to the front of my old childhood home, I know now what I must do, what I wasn't brave enough to do as a child. 

I step out of the car and look upon the derelict building before me. My old home is condemned for demolition, much like the rest of my abandoned home town. I take the can of petrol from the boot of my car, and look up to my old bedroom window. 

I can't see them yet, [but I know they'll be waiting.] (https://youtu.be/7YitHSVgTfY)

If you haven&amp;#39;t yet read that story,  or even if it has been awhile and you don&amp;#39;t quite remember it, I would advise that you read it as this post won&amp;#39;t make much sense without it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life after highschool, what a wonderful phrase. It supposedly means no worries or stress for the rest of your Summer days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ,like countless teenagers who have graduated before me, have tried to enjoy this Summer of freedom to its fullest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, all the parties after graduation were just the tip-off to a Summer that should be shooting me into adulthood. Now though, I&amp;#39;m not sure if I am going anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve spent most of the Summer working, but with how easy my job was, could you realy call it working?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been Sleep-watching. The easiest job on the planet. You&amp;#39;ve most likely heard of it by now. Its  simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All you do is sit in front of a webcam. You just sit there and do whatever you want while some person on the other end sleeps. At the end of the night, after they rest. You get paid. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started Sleep-watching a few weeks ago. It seemed  like that as soon as I got the acceptance email, I had a Watcher request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guy that picked me to watch him was a great man. His name was Dominique. An old war vet, that  would stay up and talk to me when he wasn&amp;#39;t able to sleep. He would tell me about what it was like back in the day, fighting for the good ole U.S. Of A. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He only had one problem. He had some really bad PTSD. It would only act up from time to time, but we he did he would wake up screaming. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He only told me once about what had scarred him so deeply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in &amp;#39;Nam he got ambushed. He had been on a recon mission with his squad, just a fresh-faced private at the time. 
He told me about the Hell he had been through. How enemy soldiers started swarming from the darkness of the jungle. He talked about how his squad tried to hold them back and he visibly shuddered when he described how they did their best to kill every last one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He talked about the hopelessness he had felt while fighting back wave after wave of soldiers. They just wouldn&amp;#39;t stop coming and his guys were picked off like flies. It was like they were coming out of the very ground itself.`&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thats when his friend, the other new-blood private of the group, grabbed a grenade and lobbed it into a wave of oncoming men.
The grenade did its job, and wasted almost a dozen of them, but not before a shot landed right between the eyes of the grenade throwing recruit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dominique was distant when he talked about the war. He had had this look in his eyes, like he was watching it play out before him all over again. I felt bad for him. He was alone. His family tried to visit him now and then, but for the most part he was by himself. 
During the night time though, he had me. His trusty Watcher to keep him company and to help him sleep. We became really good friends him and I. We would even call an hour early just to talk. It was like having another Grand-pa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I guess at that point, for me anyways, Summer was going pretty smoothly. I was getting paid, enjoying freedom, and for the most part not worrying about anything. But the sun has to set, even if we think we&amp;#39;re in paradise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dusk came when I found the post of my best friend Oliver. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a normal night for Dominique and I. He had fallen asleep hours before and hadn&amp;#39;t made a peep since. I was doing my regular thing, searching the web, looking for something interesting to keep me occupied. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was looking through random posts and forum threads, hopeful to find one that could keep me reading. I did. A post titled &amp;quot;Sleep-Watchers.Net&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I instantly recognized it as Olly&amp;#39;s. I mean, he always had that kind of brooding tone, even in his writing. The thing that ensured me though, was the username, Wishbone43, he used it for everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I got through his post, I just kind of figured it was a story he made up. I knew he had to have been getting bored like I did through all the late nights. At the time, I thought that it was pretty good, it even sent a few shivers down my spine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, staying up every night of the Summer. There had been times when I thought that I had seen a few  things, but nothing that seemed like it was waiting to creep out of the shadows and kill Dominique.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I even laughed to myself when I saw the comments people had left. Some like &amp;quot;Cool story, but how much did you get paid?&amp;quot; Others took it seriously. &amp;quot;Wish I could help, but you know I&amp;#39;d probably fall asleep, and then we would both be screwed.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was thoroughly convinced that his post was Oliver just being bored. He was my best friend, but he always was kind of weird. I mean I didn&amp;#39;t blame him, I&amp;#39;m a strange kid too, but something about his post did seem off. It seemed too real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thats when I started to think about it. I hadn&amp;#39;t talked to Olly in a few days. Hadn&amp;#39;t heard a single word from him. Back during the school year we had hung out after school almost every single day, but since graduation I had seen him maybe a total of four times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to text him. I mean his post had to be bogus, but it would be good to check on him and catch up with him. Maybe we could even hang out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey Bro, you up?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I waited for a response, I read through a few more comments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People were legitimately scared by Oliver&amp;#39;s tale. Some said that they looked the website up, and even though they had found it, said that they were terrified to sign up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Olly really convinced those kids that a boogey-man was watching the people of Sleep-Watchers.net, ready to take down anyone who broke the rules. I at the time, knew that that wasn&amp;#39;t true. Now though, I&amp;#39;m not so sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I checked my phone. Still no response from Olly. He could have been asleep, it was around one in the morning. I decided to not bother him anymore that night, and instead text him in the morning before I took my daily snooze. My sleep schedule was kind of a mess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent the rest of the night reading through other stories that people had posted on the forum that Olly had. There were some interesting things there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning, after Dominique had woken up, told me good morning, and gone on his way for the day. I texted Olly again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hey bro. Text me when you get the chance. Haven&amp;#39;t heard from you in awhile. Just wondering how you&amp;#39;re doing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I waited a few minutes, and still didn&amp;#39;t get any response. I figured he might have just been sleeping in, either way I needed to get to bed or I would be useless to Dominique that night. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I slept for a solid eight hours. When I woke up I had a message waiting for me on my phone. It was from Olly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Watch me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t sure what to make of his text at first. It  didn&amp;#39;t make much sense to my drowsy brain. I started to respond when I remembered his story. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was Olly seriously trying to scare me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began to text him back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ha Ha Olly. You know you may have scared those poeple online, but I&amp;#39;m a little tougher than that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;#39;t take him long to reply&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Please.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember being annoyed. Olly was acting strange. He did that from time to time, and whenever he did the only way to make him stop was to play along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Fine.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got up and found myself a late breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About an hour later, I finally made my way to the desktop I have in my room.
I signed into my profile on Sleep-watchers and had a message waiting for me. It was from Wishbone43, Olly.
It was a Watcher request. He really wanted to do this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I accepted and not even a minute later I received a text from him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Thank you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah whatever. If you&amp;#39;re trying to prank me though, I will beat you down O.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He didn&amp;#39;t respond. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His request stated that I would begin watching him at 9 until 7. I really hoped Oliver would get over whatever this was, quickly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a few hours later when I called Dominique. He was happy to see me and I was excited to see him. He may have been old, but he was damn good company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We called early, so we were able to talk for a little while. I told him about Oliver and how I was going to be watching both of them that night. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He seemed to understand. I figured he would make some kind of  joke about Oliver being a wack-o, but he didn&amp;#39;t seem to want to joke &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;about him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Watch your friend closely Manny.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had laughed at Oliver before, but the seriousness in Dominique&amp;#39;s tone made me think.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talked for a little while longer until he finally went to bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About an hour later, it was time for me to call Olly. 
As I clicked on the call button, “The Rules” which always showed up when calling a new client, popped onto my screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do not fall asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For no circumstance may you wake the Sleeper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do not touch the red emergency button unless there is an EMERGENCY.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do NOT fall asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never really understood why Sleep-Watchers.net put don&amp;#39;t fall asleep twice on that list. It seemed like it was redundant, but after reading Oliver&amp;#39;s story I had to admit that it gave me chills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took a moment for our call to connect. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I finally saw Olly, I begin to question everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He appeared on the screen with his face too close to the camera. His eyes were bloodshot, and his hair was a frizzled mess that sat low on the top of his head. He looked like he hadn&amp;#39;t showered in weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Olly, how you doing man?” I asked, trying to mask the concern that struck me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He didn&amp;#39;t respond. He just kept staring into the camera. It was like he was staring into my soul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few tense moments though, he finally said something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I&amp;#39;m going to go to sleep now. Do not wake me up.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to respond, but before I could get a word out, Oliver had jumped into bed and turned away from the camera. In moments, he was asleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something wasn&amp;#39;t right. Strings of fear began to find their way into my veins, but the more rational side of my brain, the stronger side, reminded me that Oliver was probably just playing a joke. A strange perverse joke, but a joke nontheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the night went smoothly. I had my computer screen split down the middle with the camera feed from Dominique&amp;#39;s room on one side, and Olly on the other. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent most of the night reading on my phone. Happy when the clock read 7 and not a single thing had went bump in the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the next week, the cycle repeated. I would call Dominque an hour before he went to bed and chat with him, then an hour after he fell asleep I would call Oliver. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first few nights, Olly didn&amp;#39;t say much, he would stare at me for a few minutes, mumble a few quiet incoherent sentances and then be out like a light for the rest of the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of the week though, Olly seemed to be returning to his normal self. By Friday, the fifth night of me watching him, we even joked around a little before he passed out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few nights later. I ruined everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was my fault. I&amp;#39;m the one who messed up. I&amp;#39;m the one who ruined the peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a normal morning, a week and a half since I had first started watching Olly. I was laying in bed and staring out my window. It was around 8, both Oliver and Dominique had already hung up, but unlike usual I didn&amp;#39;t feel tired. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had been Sleep-watching for over half of the Summer at that point. I spent every night staring at a screen. I hadn&amp;#39;t gotten to enjoy a day outside in a very long time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt good, I wasn&amp;#39;t sleepy at all. I figured I would be fine if I spent the day awake. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent the day outside, messing around with friends who hadn&amp;#39;t left town for college yet. I texted Olly to come join us, but I didn&amp;#39;t get &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a response. I just figured he was busy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day was good. The last good day I may ever have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That night, I called Dominique as usual and we talked awhile before he fell asleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“How are you doing Manny?” I remember him asking me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I&amp;#39;m doing good. I think Olly is finally coming back around.” I remember telling him.
He was quiet for a moment, I didn&amp;#39;t realize it at the time, but fear seemed to flash across his face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Don&amp;#39;t take your eyes off of him Manny.” He  said solemnly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Are you okay?” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I&amp;#39;m fine. I think that I should be getting to bed here pretty soon though. A tired body makes for brittle bones. Goodnight Manny.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Goodnight Dominique.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An hour later, I called Oliver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hey man, how&amp;#39;s it going?” I remember him answering the call, a smile across his face, the first I had seen from him in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I&amp;#39;m okay Olly, I hung out with Micheal and Al eariler, you should have come with.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I wish man, I had some work to do on my computer though. Maybe next time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sighed. Something was still off about Olly, but atleast he seemed to be making progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I&amp;#39;m going to go to bed Manny. Have a good night.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sleep well man.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that, Olly went to sleep. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next few hours passed by extremely slowly. I was looking for something interesting to do on my phone, but everything that I saw bored me. I couldn&amp;#39;t get my mind to focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gave up on looking at the internet. I decided that I should clear my mind and just watch the screens for awhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Horrible idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t last five minutes before my day out in the sun caught up with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I broke the rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fell asleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how long I was out. It had to have been atleast half an hour but I was awoken by a loud bang. My head shot up and it took me a minute to figure out where I was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was still at my desk. The screen of my desktop monitor lighting up the dark room around me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still trying to shake the grogginess of my accidental nap off, I began to look over the screens of my two closest friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I looked into Dominique&amp;#39;s room. I could see his large form resting in his bed. The only visible movement was his deep breathing. The breathing of an old man peacefully asleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I looked over to Olly&amp;#39;s room. The very first thing I noticed was his bed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was empty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only light in Oliver&amp;#39;s room was that of the computer screen. Shadows seemed to reek out of the corners and into the rest of the room, but even with the little light that I had, I was certain that Olly wasn&amp;#39;t there. His blankets were thrown about and his door was standing wide open, even though he had fallen asleep with it closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oliver was gone, and it looked like he had left in a hurry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to panic. I reached for my phone which was sitting on my desk when, from behind me out of the darkness, I felt a hand grip my neck. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fingers were long, hard, and cold. Long enough to wrap all the way around my neck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You fell asleep.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The voice was vicious. Full of hate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You broke the rules Manuel.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me a second, but I recognized that voice even through the bitter anger it radiated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You broke the rules and now, you&amp;#39;re going to have to pay.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt the hand around my neck begin to tighten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Olly, what the hell are you doing?” I managed to get out in a rasp wispher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The room was quiet. Oliver didn&amp;#39;t respond but his grip didn&amp;#39;t loosen. As long as I had known him, he had never been so damn strong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Olly, you don&amp;#39;t have to do this. It was a mistake, it won&amp;#39;t happen again. I swear.” I was pleading for my life with a monster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You&amp;#39;re the mistake Manuel, but don&amp;#39;t worry I can still use you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt the hand around my neck loosen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to say something else, I don&amp;#39;t remember what, but before I could  catch my breath, a fist as hard as steel smashed into my temple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just like that, for the second time that night, I was asleep on the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time though, I wish I had never woken up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came to maybe an hour later with a pounding headache. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the first time though, I didn&amp;#39;t wake up slow. I was up as fast I could be and went straight for my cellphone. I needed to call either Oliver, his parents, or the police. Somebody to help figure out what the hell was going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was scrolling my way through my contacts down to Oliver&amp;#39;s parents when out of the corner of my eye, I saw something move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first I thought that maybe Olly was still in the room with me and every hair on my body stood on end. But as I looked up from my phone, I saw that what moved, wasn&amp;#39;t in my room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was on my computer screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There, on the camera feed that focused in Dominique&amp;#39;s room, was Olly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was standing in between “me” and Dominique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was grinning. A wide grin that seemed to stretch from ear to ear. He looked tall, way taller than I ever remembered him being and his are hung limply at his sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I saw his hands my stomach tied itself into a thousand knots. They looked huge. His fingers grotesquely long. Starch white like they had been soaked in bleach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I looked at Oliver with horror, he continued to smile at me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You broke the rules Manuel. Too bad he is the one that is going to have to be punished.” His voice oozed from him like a poisonous mist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Olly, don&amp;#39;t do this!” I shouted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He smiled at me for just a moment longer before he leapt into a frenzy of action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He leaped onto Dominique&amp;#39;s bed, his enormous white hands balled into fists. With them, he began hammering into Dominique with blow after blow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He started with his face. Blood soaked everything as it shot out of Dominique&amp;#39;s skull and onto the white sheets he was laying on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The smacks of Oliver&amp;#39;s punches were loud and  each one sounded like a gunshot as it conected with Dominique&amp;#39;s face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After he pulverized Dominique&amp;#39;s head, he continued laying his oversized fists into every part of his body. Through the camera feed I could hear brittle bones splintering and cracking. Dominique didn&amp;#39;t even have a chance to open his eyes before he died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made for the emergency button. Clicking on it repeatdly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of connecting me to Dominique&amp;#39;s police station though or even showing me his address. A popup appeared. 
It read:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This feature is restricted at the current time to user: Manny_the_Man. Reason: Disobedience of the Rules.”
At the bottom of the pop up window, almost like a signature was, “O.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how. But I know Oliver must have found a way to disconnect the emergency button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the screen, Oliver was still pouding his fists into Dominique&amp;#39;s limp body. Blood was everywhere. The disgusting white hands that only an hour before had been on my neck were entirely covered in dull dark blood. Oliver was smiling that sick smile as he continued to beat Dominique into nothing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the emergency button didn&amp;#39;t work, I went for the best next thing. I whipped out my phone and called the police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They answered on the first ring and as soon as I heard the ooerator&amp;#39;s voice, I blurted out everything that was happening. She asked me to slow down, but I couldn&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When she finally understood that something bad was happening to someone good, she asked me for a location of the crime. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was when I realized that I had no idea. I knew Dominique lived in a city not too  far from me. But I had no idea where his 
apartment was, or what to tell the lady.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told her the city, and I described Oliver but as I turned back to the screen, he was gone. The only thing left behind was Dominique&amp;#39;s demolished body. The carnage that surrounded him made my stomach drop. I threw up onto the floor of my room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, it has been a day since Oliver killed Dominique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A really, really long day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The police have been at my house for hours. Asking me questions, trying to figure out where Oliver may have gone or who he may be with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told them all that I know, but the truth is that I have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They found Dominique a few hours ago. No trace of Oliver, just Dominique&amp;#39;s bloody corpse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They tried to search my computer and my phone, but so far they haven&amp;#39;t been able to find any trace of Oliver, Dominique, or anything to do with Sleep-Watchers.net. Its like everything that concerned them disappeared. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its going to get dark here soon. The police have stationed a guard outside of my house. Hoping to “protect” me, but they didn&amp;#39;t see what I saw. Oliver isn&amp;#39;t human anymore. He is something else. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know he is going to visit me again tonight, armed guard or not. He will find his way into my room and he will finish what he started. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t go down without telling my story though. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He may have deleted everything from me, shredded every piece of evidence that I have, but he can&amp;#39;t stop me from releasing my story into the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please, whoever you may be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not join Sleep-watchers.net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not look it up.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not fall for the trap that Olly and I fell for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay as far away from this fiendish nightmare as you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you happen to see a boy, freakishly tall with blood-stained white hands. Again. Stay away. Run as fast as you can. Call the cops and pray that he didn&amp;#39;t notice you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listen to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not put yourself into danger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for me, I am going to go to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A demon is coming for me when the sun goes down and I would rather be murdered in my sleep then be forced to see that face or those blood-soaked hands again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay away. Whoever you may be. Stay away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;

Life after highschool, what a wonderful phrase. It supposedly means no worries or stress for the rest of your Summer days. 

I ,like countless teenagers who have graduated before me, have tried to enjoy this Summer of freedom to its fullest. 

I mean, all the parties after graduation were just the tip-off to a Summer that should be shooting me into adulthood. Now though, I'm not sure if I am going anywhere.

I've spent most of the Summer working, but with how easy my job was, could you realy call it working?

I've been Sleep-watching. The easiest job on the planet. You've most likely heard of it by now. Its  simple.

All you do is sit in front of a webcam. You just sit there and do whatever you want while some person on the other end sleeps. At the end of the night, after they rest. You get paid. 

I started Sleep-watching a few weeks ago. It seemed  like that as soon as I got the acceptance email, I had a Watcher request.

The guy that picked me to watch him was a great man. His name was Dominique. An old war vet, that  would stay up and talk to me when he wasn't able to sleep. He would tell me about what it was like back in the day, fighting for the good ole U.S. Of A. 

He only had one problem. He had some really bad PTSD. It would only act up from time to time, but we he did he would wake up screaming. 

He only told me once about what had scarred him so deeply.

Back in 'Nam he got ambushed. He had been on a recon mission with his squad, just a fresh-faced private at the time. 
He told me about the Hell he had been through. How enemy soldiers started swarming from the darkness of the jungle. He talked about how his squad tried to hold them back and he visibly shuddered when he described how they did their best to kill every last one of them.

He talked about the hopelessness he had felt while fighting back wave after wave of soldiers. They just wouldn't stop coming and his guys were picked off like flies. It was like they were coming out of the very ground itself.`

Thats when his friend, the other new-blood private of the group, grabbed a grenade and lobbed it into a wave of oncoming men.
The grenade did its job, and wasted almost a dozen of them, but not before a shot landed right between the eyes of the grenade throwing recruit.

Dominique was distant when he talked about the war. He had had this look in his eyes, like he was watching it play out before him all over again. I felt bad for him. He was alone. His family tried to visit him now and then, but for the most part he was by himself. 
During the night time though, he had me. His trusty Watcher to keep him company and to help him sleep. We became really good friends him and I. We would even call an hour early just to talk. It was like having another Grand-pa.

So I guess at that point, for me anyways, Summer was going pretty smoothly. I was getting paid, enjoying freedom, and for the most part not worrying about anything. But the sun has to set, even if we think we're in paradise.

Dusk came when I found the post of my best friend Oliver. 

It was a normal night for Dominique and I. He had fallen asleep hours before and hadn't made a peep since. I was doing my regular thing, searching the web, looking for something interesting to keep me occupied. 

I was looking through random posts and forum threads, hopeful to find one that could keep me reading. I did. A post titled "Sleep-Watchers.Net". 

I instantly recognized it as Olly's. I mean, he always had that kind of brooding tone, even in his writing. The thing that ensured me though, was the username, Wishbone43, he used it for everything.

As I got through his post, I just kind of figured it was a story he made up. I knew he had to have been getting bored like I did through all the late nights. At the time, I thought that it was pretty good, it even sent a few shivers down my spine.

I mean, staying up every night of the Summer. There had been times when I thought that I had seen a few  things, but nothing that seemed like it was waiting to creep out of the shadows and kill Dominique.  

I even laughed to myself when I saw the comments people had left. Some like "Cool story, but how much did you get paid?" Others took it seriously. "Wish I could help, but you know I'd probably fall asleep, and then we would both be screwed."

I was thoroughly convinced that his post was Oliver just being bored. He was my best friend, but he always was kind of weird. I mean I didn't blame him, I'm a strange kid too, but something about his post did seem off. It seemed too real.

Thats when I started to think about it. I hadn't talked to Olly in a few days. Hadn't heard a single word from him. Back during the school year we had hung out after school almost every single day, but since graduation I had seen him maybe a total of four times.

I decided to text him. I mean his post had to be bogus, but it would be good to check on him and catch up with him. Maybe we could even hang out.

"Hey Bro, you up?"

While I waited for a response, I read through a few more comments. 

People were legitimately scared by Oliver's tale. Some said that they looked the website up, and even though they had found it, said that they were terrified to sign up.

Olly really convinced those kids that a boogey-man was watching the people of Sleep-Watchers.net, ready to take down anyone who broke the rules. I at the time, knew that that wasn't true. Now though, I'm not so sure.

I checked my phone. Still no response from Olly. He could have been asleep, it was around one in the morning. I decided to not bother him anymore that night, and instead text him in the morning before I took my daily snooze. My sleep schedule was kind of a mess.

I spent the rest of the night reading through other stories that people had posted on the forum that Olly had. There were some interesting things there. 

The next morning, after Dominique had woken up, told me good morning, and gone on his way for the day. I texted Olly again.

“Hey bro. Text me when you get the chance. Haven't heard from you in awhile. Just wondering how you're doing.”

I waited a few minutes, and still didn't get any response. I figured he might have just been sleeping in, either way I needed to get to bed or I would be useless to Dominique that night. 

I slept for a solid eight hours. When I woke up I had a message waiting for me on my phone. It was from Olly.

“Watch me.”

I wasn't sure what to make of his text at first. It  didn't make much sense to my drowsy brain. I started to respond when I remembered his story. 

Was Olly seriously trying to scare me?

I began to text him back.

“Ha Ha Olly. You know you may have scared those poeple online, but I'm a little tougher than that.”

It didn't take him long to reply

“Please.”

I remember being annoyed. Olly was acting strange. He did that from time to time, and whenever he did the only way to make him stop was to play along.

“Fine.”

I got up and found myself a late breakfast.

About an hour later, I finally made my way to the desktop I have in my room.
I signed into my profile on Sleep-watchers and had a message waiting for me. It was from Wishbone43, Olly.
It was a Watcher request. He really wanted to do this. 

I accepted and not even a minute later I received a text from him.

“Thank you.”

“Yeah whatever. If you're trying to prank me though, I will beat you down O.”

He didn't respond. 

His request stated that I would begin watching him at 9 until 7. I really hoped Oliver would get over whatever this was, quickly. 

It was a few hours later when I called Dominique. He was happy to see me and I was excited to see him. He may have been old, but he was damn good company.

We called early, so we were able to talk for a little while. I told him about Oliver and how I was going to be watching both of them that night. 

He seemed to understand. I figured he would make some kind of  joke about Oliver being a wack-o, but he didn't seem to want to joke 

about him. 

“Watch your friend closely Manny.”

I had laughed at Oliver before, but the seriousness in Dominique's tone made me think.  

We talked for a little while longer until he finally went to bed.

About an hour later, it was time for me to call Olly. 
As I clicked on the call button, “The Rules” which always showed up when calling a new client, popped onto my screen.

1. Do not fall asleep.

2. For no circumstance may you wake the Sleeper.

3. Do not touch the red emergency button unless there is an EMERGENCY.

4. Do NOT fall asleep.

I never really understood why Sleep-Watchers.net put don't fall asleep twice on that list. It seemed like it was redundant, but after reading Oliver's story I had to admit that it gave me chills.

It took a moment for our call to connect. 

When I finally saw Olly, I begin to question everything.

He appeared on the screen with his face too close to the camera. His eyes were bloodshot, and his hair was a frizzled mess that sat low on the top of his head. He looked like he hadn't showered in weeks.

“Olly, how you doing man?” I asked, trying to mask the concern that struck me.

He didn't respond. He just kept staring into the camera. It was like he was staring into my soul.

After a few tense moments though, he finally said something.

“I'm going to go to sleep now. Do not wake me up.”

I went to respond, but before I could get a word out, Oliver had jumped into bed and turned away from the camera. In moments, he was asleep.

Something wasn't right. Strings of fear began to find their way into my veins, but the more rational side of my brain, the stronger side, reminded me that Oliver was probably just playing a joke. A strange perverse joke, but a joke nontheless.

The rest of the night went smoothly. I had my computer screen split down the middle with the camera feed from Dominique's room on one side, and Olly on the other. 

I spent most of the night reading on my phone. Happy when the clock read 7 and not a single thing had went bump in the night.

For the next week, the cycle repeated. I would call Dominque an hour before he went to bed and chat with him, then an hour after he fell asleep I would call Oliver. 

The first few nights, Olly didn't say much, he would stare at me for a few minutes, mumble a few quiet incoherent sentances and then be out like a light for the rest of the night.

By the end of the week though, Olly seemed to be returning to his normal self. By Friday, the fifth night of me watching him, we even joked around a little before he passed out.

A few nights later. I ruined everything.

It was my fault. I'm the one who messed up. I'm the one who ruined the peace.

It was a normal morning, a week and a half since I had first started watching Olly. I was laying in bed and staring out my window. It was around 8, both Oliver and Dominique had already hung up, but unlike usual I didn't feel tired. 

I had been Sleep-watching for over half of the Summer at that point. I spent every night staring at a screen. I hadn't gotten to enjoy a day outside in a very long time. 

I felt good, I wasn't sleepy at all. I figured I would be fine if I spent the day awake. 

I spent the day outside, messing around with friends who hadn't left town for college yet. I texted Olly to come join us, but I didn't get 

a response. I just figured he was busy.

The day was good. The last good day I may ever have.

That night, I called Dominique as usual and we talked awhile before he fell asleep.

“How are you doing Manny?” I remember him asking me.

“I'm doing good. I think Olly is finally coming back around.” I remember telling him.
He was quiet for a moment, I didn't realize it at the time, but fear seemed to flash across his face.

“Don't take your eyes off of him Manny.” He  said solemnly.

“Are you okay?” 

“I'm fine. I think that I should be getting to bed here pretty soon though. A tired body makes for brittle bones. Goodnight Manny.”

“Goodnight Dominique.”

An hour later, I called Oliver.

“Hey man, how's it going?” I remember him answering the call, a smile across his face, the first I had seen from him in a long time.

“I'm okay Olly, I hung out with Micheal and Al eariler, you should have come with.”

“I wish man, I had some work to do on my computer though. Maybe next time.”

I sighed. Something was still off about Olly, but atleast he seemed to be making progress.

“I'm going to go to bed Manny. Have a good night.”

“Sleep well man.”

With that, Olly went to sleep. 

The next few hours passed by extremely slowly. I was looking for something interesting to do on my phone, but everything that I saw bored me. I couldn't get my mind to focus.

I gave up on looking at the internet. I decided that I should clear my mind and just watch the screens for awhile.

Horrible idea.

I didn't last five minutes before my day out in the sun caught up with me.

I broke the rules.

I fell asleep.

I don't know how long I was out. It had to have been atleast half an hour but I was awoken by a loud bang. My head shot up and it took me a minute to figure out where I was.

I was still at my desk. The screen of my desktop monitor lighting up the dark room around me. 

Still trying to shake the grogginess of my accidental nap off, I began to look over the screens of my two closest friends.

First, I looked into Dominique's room. I could see his large form resting in his bed. The only visible movement was his deep breathing. The breathing of an old man peacefully asleep.

Next, I looked over to Olly's room. The very first thing I noticed was his bed. 

It was empty.

The only light in Oliver's room was that of the computer screen. Shadows seemed to reek out of the corners and into the rest of the room, but even with the little light that I had, I was certain that Olly wasn't there. His blankets were thrown about and his door was standing wide open, even though he had fallen asleep with it closed.

Oliver was gone, and it looked like he had left in a hurry.

I started to panic. I reached for my phone which was sitting on my desk when, from behind me out of the darkness, I felt a hand grip my neck. 

The fingers were long, hard, and cold. Long enough to wrap all the way around my neck.

“You fell asleep.”

The voice was vicious. Full of hate.

“You broke the rules Manuel.”

It took me a second, but I recognized that voice even through the bitter anger it radiated.

“You broke the rules and now, you're going to have to pay.”

I felt the hand around my neck begin to tighten.

“Olly, what the hell are you doing?” I managed to get out in a rasp wispher.

The room was quiet. Oliver didn't respond but his grip didn't loosen. As long as I had known him, he had never been so damn strong. 

“Olly, you don't have to do this. It was a mistake, it won't happen again. I swear.” I was pleading for my life with a monster.

“You're the mistake Manuel, but don't worry I can still use you.”

I felt the hand around my neck loosen. 

I went to say something else, I don't remember what, but before I could  catch my breath, a fist as hard as steel smashed into my temple.

And just like that, for the second time that night, I was asleep on the job.

This time though, I wish I had never woken up.

I came to maybe an hour later with a pounding headache. 

Unlike the first time though, I didn't wake up slow. I was up as fast I could be and went straight for my cellphone. I needed to call either Oliver, his parents, or the police. Somebody to help figure out what the hell was going on.

I was scrolling my way through my contacts down to Oliver's parents when out of the corner of my eye, I saw something move.

At first I thought that maybe Olly was still in the room with me and every hair on my body stood on end. But as I looked up from my phone, I saw that what moved, wasn't in my room.

It was on my computer screen.

There, on the camera feed that focused in Dominique's room, was Olly.

He was standing in between “me” and Dominique.

He was grinning. A wide grin that seemed to stretch from ear to ear. He looked tall, way taller than I ever remembered him being and his are hung limply at his sides.

When I saw his hands my stomach tied itself into a thousand knots. They looked huge. His fingers grotesquely long. Starch white like they had been soaked in bleach.

As I looked at Oliver with horror, he continued to smile at me.

“You broke the rules Manuel. Too bad he is the one that is going to have to be punished.” His voice oozed from him like a poisonous mist.

“Olly, don't do this!” I shouted.

He smiled at me for just a moment longer before he leapt into a frenzy of action.

He leaped onto Dominique's bed, his enormous white hands balled into fists. With them, he began hammering into Dominique with blow after blow.

He started with his face. Blood soaked everything as it shot out of Dominique's skull and onto the white sheets he was laying on. 

The smacks of Oliver's punches were loud and  each one sounded like a gunshot as it conected with Dominique's face.

After he pulverized Dominique's head, he continued laying his oversized fists into every part of his body. Through the camera feed I could hear brittle bones splintering and cracking. Dominique didn't even have a chance to open his eyes before he died.

I made for the emergency button. Clicking on it repeatdly. 

Instead of connecting me to Dominique's police station though or even showing me his address. A popup appeared. 
It read:

“This feature is restricted at the current time to user: Manny_the_Man. Reason: Disobedience of the Rules.”
At the bottom of the pop up window, almost like a signature was, “O.”

I don't know how. But I know Oliver must have found a way to disconnect the emergency button.

On the screen, Oliver was still pouding his fists into Dominique's limp body. Blood was everywhere. The disgusting white hands that only an hour before had been on my neck were entirely covered in dull dark blood. Oliver was smiling that sick smile as he continued to beat Dominique into nothing. 

Since the emergency button didn't work, I went for the best next thing. I whipped out my phone and called the police.

They answered on the first ring and as soon as I heard the ooerator's voice, I blurted out everything that was happening. She asked me to slow down, but I couldn't. 

When she finally understood that something bad was happening to someone good, she asked me for a location of the crime. 

That was when I realized that I had no idea. I knew Dominique lived in a city not too  far from me. But I had no idea where his 
apartment was, or what to tell the lady.

I told her the city, and I described Oliver but as I turned back to the screen, he was gone. The only thing left behind was Dominique's demolished body. The carnage that surrounded him made my stomach drop. I threw up onto the floor of my room.

Currently, it has been a day since Oliver killed Dominique.

A really, really long day.

The police have been at my house for hours. Asking me questions, trying to figure out where Oliver may have gone or who he may be with. 

I told them all that I know, but the truth is that I have no idea.

They found Dominique a few hours ago. No trace of Oliver, just Dominique's bloody corpse. 

They tried to search my computer and my phone, but so far they haven't been able to find any trace of Oliver, Dominique, or anything to do with Sleep-Watchers.net. Its like everything that concerned them disappeared. 

Its going to get dark here soon. The police have stationed a guard outside of my house. Hoping to “protect” me, but they didn't see what I saw. Oliver isn't human anymore. He is something else. 

I know he is going to visit me again tonight, armed guard or not. He will find his way into my room and he will finish what he started. 

I won't go down without telling my story though. 

He may have deleted everything from me, shredded every piece of evidence that I have, but he can't stop me from releasing my story into the public.

So, here it is.

Please, whoever you may be.

Do not join Sleep-watchers.net.

Do not look it up.  

Do not fall for the trap that Olly and I fell for. 

Stay as far away from this fiendish nightmare as you can.

If you happen to see a boy, freakishly tall with blood-stained white hands. Again. Stay away. Run as fast as you can. Call the cops and pray that he didn't notice you.

Listen to me. 

Do not put yourself into danger.

As for me, I am going to go to sleep.

A demon is coming for me when the sun goes down and I would rather be murdered in my sleep then be forced to see that face or those blood-soaked hands again. 

Stay away. Whoever you may be. Stay away.

&lt;p&gt;I just moved to this small town in the middle of nowhere. I have no friends, and no family nearby and I fucking hate my job for doing this to me. I used to live in NYC surrounded by friends and family and a place that I loved. The company I worked for has a little building in the middle of nowhere outside of the state of New York, five hours to be exact.  I couldn’t bring any furniture from my old apartment since it came with my house,  so I took to your typical furniture stores, Target, Ikea, and so on. Except there are none here, not even a fucking Mc Donald’s. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short I ordered most of my furniture online, except for things like a entryway table and mirrors and hangers- things like that.  I love antiques and older things in general so I went looking for a thrift store or even a freaking Goodwill at this point I was desperate. 
I was driving around and saw this tiny place that said “ Back To The Future Antiques” . 
I walked in  and immediately something was off. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one else was there, and a older woman was working at the back. She said the typical How may I help you and that type of stuff. As I looked around at the creepy ass dolls and stuffed animals, I found exactly what I was looking for.  A mirror sat on top of a desk ( they were not connected) with beautiful gold detailing around the actual mirror.  I looked at the price tag and found that it was only $10. It was a great deal. I brought the mirror along with a plain jane nightstand up to the lady, and she said &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“ That is quite a lovely piece, a young woman just brought it in yesterday, and remember no returns on anything”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was weird but, I just  made small talk and she told me of a strip mall just outside of town where there were places to eat and shop. I said thank you and goodbye and made my way home to cook some ramen.  I hung up the mirror in my bedroom and put the nightstand near my bed and began to cook.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was just sitting down to my meal thinking this might not be that bad after all when I heard a crash from my bedroom. What you need to first know is that across from the mirror is a bookshelf with knickknacks that my parents had given me along with the furniture that was in the house until Target came through with my other things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, of course I went to go check it out and a right across from my mirror, a little glass lucky cat from China, was shattered and all over the floor. Then a pig shattered and then a monkey. I was shaking, until I looked in the mirror. A figure shaped like a little girl was all black, no eyes no mouth nothing, she was  looking right at me. Then, I blacked out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That happened last night. I have sort of believed in ghosts watching Shane Dawson and all that shit ( i’m not saying Shane’s content is shit, i actually love him)  but nothing had prepared me for this. I think there is a demon in my mirror so I went to you reddit. Please give me advice on what to do, I am truly desperate. Help&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;

                    [selftext_html] => &lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I noticed it about three days ago. An intense, gnawing in my forearm. The type of itch that just won&amp;#39;t be satisfied no matter how hard you scratch. A &amp;quot;beneath the surface&amp;quot; feeling of even your blood cells needing that sweet relief that only your fingernails seem to bring. You can ask others to scratch but that goosebumps satisfaction is only really brought on by your own doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I commute to my shitty cubical office job by subway every morning around 6am. There always seems to be too much traffic at that hour,every one else sleepily rushing by to their own daily grind to bring home the bacon. I&amp;#39;ve never had any problems on my way to work. Sure, it smelled like it hadn&amp;#39;t been touched by the sanitation team in God knows how long, and there always seemed to be at least one person talking to an empty chair beside them, but it beat the stop and go blur of taillights and I was willing to put up with the occasional alien abduction story if it meant I could keep my sanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually I always seem to find myself lucky with a chair opening up right as I step in from the platform but on this day it was unusually crowded, so I was forced to stand, holding on to the little straps they provided. I much preferred a seat in the mornings because my body was never prepared for the sudden jolt of the train being let off its breaks. It was no different this morning as my strength and body betrayed me, sending me to be violently jerked backwards and onto the floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was extremely embarrassing, but I played it off with a short little laugh and mumbled something about the gears needing some grease and let my mind retreat to the anxiety safety net of my cell phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mind came out of its social media coma and back to the world around me as I heard a loud ding, and braced for the screech and sudden halt. The doors popped open and I stepped out onto the platform of an underground urban jungle. &lt;em&gt;This early in the morning and they&amp;#39;re already going at it?!&lt;/em&gt; my frustration was apparent as I walked quickly by a pair of young adults beating on buckets and playing the saxophone with as much talent and enthusiasm as a ten year old in a music store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was late to the office again, but no one seemed to notice as I slunk through the doors and beelined straight for my office. The day itself was uneventful, aside from a few conference calls and the occasional sign offs, I spent the day sleeping in my chair. It was a blessing having blinders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ride home was uneventful aside from Greg the subway rat telling me about his latest invention. If you were looking for a way to stay awake on your ride home, Greg is your answer. He didn&amp;#39;t stop talking for the entire 45 minute sub ride about I had no idea how to understand, and I don&amp;#39;t think he did either. Sweet guy though. Lives on the east side in a railcar and spends a majority of his time trying to sell his Frankenstein nic-nacks. That&amp;#39;s actually how we met about a year ago, he sold me a very unusual piece of art /machinery that consisted of an electric toothbrush attached to a baby doll head. Neither of us was sure of what to use it for, but  I think I still have it somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, once I got home, I noticed a small irritated rash on my elbow in the mirror. I chalked it up to skin irritation assuming a hot shower with mild soap would do the trick. Nope. When I woke up that next morning, the thing had gone from small rash to baseball-sized welt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to urgent care and suffered through a two hour wait filled with the sounds of never ending sick child cries, and the smell of only an urgent care in downtown could have. No, my company doesn&amp;#39;t have any kind of insurance, otherwise I would have gotten the good stuff instead of the generic cortisone they prescribed me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After applying that and spending the rest of my free sick day playing video games and lounging around the house I cracked open a beer and passed out maybe an hour later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was only asleep for maybe two hours when I was awoken by an intense itching sensation. It was so strong that I was forced awake out of a drunken slumber to find myself going at my arm with my fingernails. I went to the bathroom to check my arm and to my surprise the rash and welt were completely gone, only to be replaced by an intense itch.  There wasn&amp;#39;t even redness from having just scratched. I assumed that the cream was working its magic and that the itching was a mild short-lived setback from being healed completely. I stumbled back to bed and occasionally found myself itching my arm throughout the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subway ride to work this morning was uneventful compared to prior days. In fact, it seemed almost eerily empty for a Tuesday morning. Not even Greg was there to great me with a new story. The itching had grown immensely since the previous night and it was impossible to put my other hand down to stop the scratching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hadn&amp;#39;t stopped scratching as I entered the office building, but I noticed that a few others were experiencing the same issue. Janice in HR had her jacket down while Kim from accounting was going to town with a hairbrush on her back. I turned the corner and found Jim in a horrid sight. His pant leg was up, and he was scratching feverishly  at his calf, blood smearing all over his leg and fingers. I had to hold back vomit as I backed up into my office, shutting the door and locking it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few hours of mind-numbing paperwork and trying to get the images of this morning out of my head, I decided to take a break, pushing back from my desk and walking to the window, stopping to scratch my upper shoulder on the way over. I was looking down at the street below, and noticed a woman walking down the street. She seemed like an upper class woman and was on the phone, and my breath caught in my throat when she stopped briefly to scratch at her neck. I was beginning to get paranoid, but I had deadlines to reach so I  returned to my desk to finish my work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of nowhere, my left arm stopped, mid keystroke. The painful itch was so intense I couldn&amp;#39;t breathe. I had never felt anything like it in my entire life. It made the rest of my body slightly spasm and I yanked myself out of my desk, chair toppling over, ripping my coat off. I rolled up my sleeve and looked down at my arm. There was no redness, and no visible irritation. &lt;em&gt;No, wait.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I looked closer my eyes widened in horror. Something had begun to move under the surface. I cried out,   not in pain, but in complete fear as they began to break the surface. My eyes were so wide and so strained that with a pressure of a sneeze they would surely pop out of their sockets and roll to the floor. I watched, frozen, as hundreds of tiny little black bugs the size of a freckle, pushed their way out of my pores and began a steady march across my body. A few even stopped to snack on my little arm hairs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began shaking my arm in rapid desperation to get them off. My panic grew as I ran to the mirror and witnessed with unresolved despair as the skin under my face began to move and bubble. I child-like groan of terror escaped my throat as a large welt began to form and within seconds the monstrosity had burst open on my forehead and out poured a steady stream of these tiny black little beetles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I screamed and tried my best to wipe them out of my eyes and keep them from crawling back into my body through my nose and ears but my efforts were fruitless. I finally dropped to the floor, my body twitching. I writhed and clawed at the side of my face as I listened to the deafening sound of thousands of tiny legs in my eardrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I crawled like an injured,  infant animal over to my desk phone and dialed 911. My mouth was full of these creatures as they continued to feast on my enamel and gums and I was unable to form anything other than inhuman gutteral wails for help. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully they were able to track the call and get to the office in time to save myself and six of my coworkers suffering from the same symptoms. They had to amputate my arm, and flush my system. They still have to pick these things out of me every day until they die off. Jim lost his leg, and his left hand. Janice from HR wasn&amp;#39;t as lucky. The infection started in her back, and those little bastards are their way through the heart and out if the chest bursting open into the face and mouth of Kim from accounting, who is in quarantine at the moment. The surgeons said they&amp;#39;d never seen anything like it, but were able to narrow it down to a bacterial parasite infection they had never seen before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They say they&amp;#39;re dealing with more and more cases by the day and to help spread the word as much as we can to others. They explained the only way to remain safe is to keep open wounds covered, don&amp;#39;t share drinks, avoid ANYTHING you think someone might have coughed on, avoid EVERYONE who says they&amp;#39;re suffering from any sort of flu symptoms and absolutely at all costs avoid any form of public transit including planes, busses, trains, and yes, &lt;em&gt;subways&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

I would have posted this yesterday, but I ran into the 24-hour rule. &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7upiqw/i_hear_music_through_my_walls/"&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a link to part one.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I slept in the car last night, even though I nearly froze. I just couldn&amp;#39;t take the idea of staying in that house again. I&amp;#39;m really freaked out. And what makes things worse: my mom won&amp;#39;t even talk to me about it. I tried bringing it up, but when I told her about how I went over to the other side of the duplex, she just yelled at me. She claims she doesn&amp;#39;t hear music and she said that if we can&amp;#39;t get tenants, it&amp;#39;s my fault! I don&amp;#39;t know what I was supposed to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least today was a school day. (So weird to think that, right?) I tried to see if someone couldn&amp;#39;t let me crash, but I&amp;#39;m still not close enough with anyone. Not that it mattered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple people on this forum suggested that there might be a dead girl in my house (including one jerk who claimed that this was all my fault), so I stopped by the library after school. If I can find &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; it&amp;#39;s haunted, maybe I could do something about it, right? They had old newspapers on microfiche, going all the way back to the 1890&amp;#39;s. I don&amp;#39;t know if I was lucky or not, but I did manage to find a story about the people who used to live here. You can see the paper (&lt;a href="http://allen-poole.com/media/images/Anderson_Times.original.png"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). It&amp;#39;s weird, the Anderson family got a huge headline and the main picture even though the second front page story is about Al Capone. I guess the girl&amp;#39;s disappearance was more important for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you can&amp;#39;t read it, the headline says &amp;quot;SEARCH FOR MISSING ANDERSON GIRL CALLED OFF AFTER THREE MONTHS.&amp;quot; The story then talks about how one of the girls in the Anderson family (Sara, their older daughter) disappeared and hadn&amp;#39;t been seen again. This was especially tragic since it looks like their other daughter died earlier that year, though I can&amp;#39;t find much on why. There&amp;#39;s just a basic obit that doesn&amp;#39;t talk about how she died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The family was supposed to be pretty important in town. The dad was like this banker, and the mom was (and this part really freaks me out) was a piano teacher. It says that the girl hadn&amp;#39;t been seen in months when the police finally gave up. I haven&amp;#39;t found anything else about either the Anderson family or any other clues about Sara Anderson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also able to talk the librarian into letting me copy a picture from their town history exhibit. This is the picture of the Anderson girls in front of their house (&lt;a href="http://allen-poole.com/media/images/Anderson_house.original.png"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). It looks like it is the same one that is in the newspaper. This is a picture of my house I took earlier today (&lt;a href="http://allen-poole.com/media/images/my-home.original.png"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). It&amp;#39;s pretty obvious they&amp;#39;re the same one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I got home, my mom was already there. She should have still been at work, but there she was, sitting at the kitchen table. She was acting really weird, too, talking about practicing and an &amp;quot;upcoming performance.&amp;quot; I tried to ask her what she was talking about, but she just repeated how I needed to keep working if I wanted to be any good. Good at what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She did say that we&amp;#39;re going to have some tenants, which is good. Hopefully, she&amp;#39;ll be less stressed when we get some more money flowing in. Even with everything going wrong, I think things will be better if there are more people in this house, if we aren&amp;#39;t always so alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to avoid my mom for the rest of the day, which I think was a good thing. She&amp;#39;s started acting pretty weird. I even caught her talking to herself. I&amp;#39;ve never seen her act this way, even when she got into fights with dad. She looks like a total wreck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the part that really freaked me out was that she bought a piano. It&amp;#39;s one of those old, small ones. You know the type: about the size of a small bookshelf, maybe four-and-a-half, five foot tall. There&amp;#39;s always one in the local rec. center, hasn&amp;#39;t been tuned in a decade. But this one wasn&amp;#39;t at a rec. center, it was in the middle of our main hallway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw that and I almost wet myself. What the hell is going on in my house? What is my mom even doing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that last night I didn&amp;#39;t see anything strange, just the piano music. The piano&amp;#39;s still there, but no little girls with missing faces. I guess that&amp;#39;s a small favor. Maybe. This whole thing is just, just messed up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of you asked me if I could tell what song I could hear through the walls. I couldn&amp;#39;t figure it out. It sounds pretty easy though? I mean, it isn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;chopsticks&amp;quot; easy, but maybe it&amp;#39;s really hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to make a recording of it (&lt;a href="http://allen-poole.com/documents/3/Anderson-house.mp3"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), which I guess is a good thing. I&amp;#39;m sorry about the quality, but there really isn&amp;#39;t anything I can do about it. I &lt;em&gt;will not&lt;/em&gt; go back into the tenant&amp;#39;s side of the house. It has nothing to do with someone wanting to rent that place either. After last night I&amp;#39;m scared. I&amp;#39;m really, really scared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I needed to record it through the wall. I&amp;#39;m afraid my mic caught a little noise, and I don&amp;#39;t know how to clean up the recording. I can&amp;#39;t get rid of that &amp;quot;shhh&amp;quot; in the background. I tried using some software and there was a tool called &amp;quot;noise reduction,&amp;quot; but that just made the entire thing softer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can someone here please tell me what song this is? I don&amp;#39;t recognize it, but I don&amp;#39;t know anything about piano music. No idea if that will help, but it can&amp;#39;t hurt. Meanwhile, I&amp;#39;m going to try to stay out of sight for the next couple of days. I&amp;#39;m still pretty freaked out, and things are &lt;a href="http://allen-poole.com/creative/tag/horror/"&gt;only getting worse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

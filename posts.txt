She had recently dropped out of college and wanted to get as far away from her family and their judgement as possible. She decided to move to a small town practically in the middle of nowhere. This was the kind of town where everybody knows everybody, and everyone knows everything that happens. It had a kind of an eerie feel to it, but from what I&amp;#39;ve gathered through travels, most small towns feel that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arrived to her house after 13 hours of nonstop travel. Driving into the town was odd. The sign said &amp;quot;Welcome&amp;quot; but I didn&amp;#39;t feel as though I was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I passed the sign, I felt a chill run down my spine. Strange. I pulled up to the address my friend had given me, slightly confused as to how worn down the house looked since she had told me she fixed it up. It was just past 7pm and it was dark outside. No lights were on inside the house. I pulled the keys out of the ignition and started towards the front door. I rang the bell. Nothing. I waited for a few more minutes, occasionally glancing at the road for any signs of headlights. Nothing. I knocked on the door and rang the bell once more before deciding to go back to wait in my car. I pulled out my phone to text her as I sat down. She responded telling me that she was really sorry and that she had stepped out to go to the store, but would be back shortly and that the door was unlocked if I wanted to go in. I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I opened the door, a strong, musty scent washed over me. Switching on the lights, the dusty interior of the home was revealed. It didn&amp;#39;t seem like anyone had tidied up in quite a while. Being a bit of a neat freak, I looked around for something to clean with. After looking for a few minutes I found what I thought was the storage closet. Maybe there&amp;#39;d be a duster or a mop or a broom or something. I put my hand on the doorknob and instantly pulled away. It burned. I looked down at my palm and it started to blister. Fire. Panicking, I looked around for an oven mitt or a dishtowel so I could open it, and a fire hydrant to put out the fire when I got to it. I found a pot holder and the extinguisher under the sink and prepared to open the door, tying a dishtowel around my mouth and nose to protect me from the fire. I slowly approached the door, extinguisher ready, and turned the doorknob, pulling the door open as quickly as possible and extinguishing the fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stood in the doorway, waiting for the smoke to clear. When it did, I was horrified. The room was metal on all four walls. The inside of the door was as well. The floor was linoleum. That&amp;#39;s not what scared me. What scared me were the bodies. Some chained to the wall, others strapped to what looked like operating tables. Some just lying on the floor. The scene was gruesome. Charred bodies. Some of them still had identifiable features. The fire must have been started recently. All of these people were gagged in one way or another. Some of them with rags, ball gags, bits, socks. A few of them naked. Some clothed in latex. A few of them cut open. Some seemed as though they were still alive. They were. I made eye contact with one of the bodies on the floor. Tears were streaming out of their eyes, their mouth still blocked by a rag. I stood there. Shaking. I tried to speak, but nothing came out. I tried again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m gonna....I&amp;#39;m gonna call....c-call for help,&amp;quot; I choked out. They blinked at me and nodded, their face contorting in pain. I pulled out my phone and dialed 911. After the call ended, my friend sent me a text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It read: I&amp;#39;m home. Where are you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked at my phone in shock and slowly walked to look out the front window. Nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sent her a text: What do you mean? I&amp;#39;m in your house. 47 Walnut Road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She called me. &amp;quot;I live at 47 Walnut Lane, you dummy,&amp;quot; She chuckled. I didn&amp;#39;t respond. &amp;quot;Luna? Are you okay?&amp;quot; I still didn&amp;#39;t reply. &amp;quot;Hello,&amp;quot; she sounded concerned. I took a shaky, deep breath and looked down at my burnt hand as I saw the red and blue lights flashing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m gonna have to call you back,&amp;quot; I choked, &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t feel so good.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What do you-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hung up the phone and crumpled to the floor, finally letting out a sob. The police barged in the door.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s as if they’re practicing the motion for when I squeeze the life from his small body. And it will happen soon. Finally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve watched the boy for years. Watched him grow from an infant to a toddler to the preteen he is now. He smiles easily. His heart is innocent and carefree. I will make sure it stops beating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my recent breakthroughs took me beyond the viewing screen and allowed me to transport into his room as he slept. I hadn’t perfected my technique to be there physically at that point, but that was coming. Just my consciousness would travel. I floated over his bed and gazed down. My hatred seethed, and, for a moment, I feared he sensed my presence because his eyes flew open and he gasped. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If he did detect me, he couldn’t have known. He probably assumed it was just a bad dream. I watched as his eyelids grew heavy and he drifted off again. My acorporeal self smirked as I pictured those eyes never opening again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through these encounters, I’ve missed my wife. The love of my life had been taken from me by the hated creature so blissfully sleeping in his bed. He had no idea what kind of monster he would become in the future. Memories of my beloved’s soft touch flooded my mind as I estimated how many times I could stab the boy through his face before I’d be forced to stop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I managed to solve the missing part of my experiment. The first few years I was limited to the view screen. A year ago, I conquered the problem of mind movement. Now, finally, I can physically bridge the span of time. My mind and body can cross over. I can stand, strong and powerful, over the murderer in his bed. His strength will be no match for mine. If he sees me and screams, it won’t matter. Help will be too far away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I write this now as I prepare to make that temporal journey to bring my wife back into the world. I glow with sadistic glee as I imagine how I’ll do it; how I’ll destroy her murderer. Will I strangle him, as I’ve so often fantasized? Will I cut his soft throat? Will I decorate his pillow with smeared clumps of the brain that later made the decisions that annihilated the woman I loved?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of it is up for grabs. The most important thing is that the boy must die. He cannot, under any circumstances, grow up. In these last moments, the glee has grown bittersweet. When it’s all over, my loved one will have been brought back. Her life can resume as if nothing had ever happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She’ll never know, though. She’ll never learn about the sacrifice I’m making. Her death had been an accident - a terrible, careless one by a young scientist too egocentric and arrogant to use caution. But that accident is about to be reversed. In a few seconds, I’ll be going back in time to ensure it will never happen. The thought of her reappearing somewhere, safely, when I’m finished, helps make the prospect of killing the child all the better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though it means my wife will have never known me at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though it means I will blink out of existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s time to go. Everything I’ve worked so hard to do is coming to fruition. Should this note remain, let it be the only record of my life after the age of 11 -- the age I was murdered by &lt;a href="https://unsettlingstories.com"&gt;my future self&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m not talking about minor frustrations with your character. I’m talking about really fucking &lt;em&gt;hating&lt;/em&gt; yourself. When you just bubble up inside with the most venomous self-loathing madness to the point where you inflict self harm, consider suicide, or even try to kill yourself? Hopefully not many of you have experienced that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anxiety is a bitch. That’s usually how it starts. It’s an unsuspecting shadow that creeps up on you and begins to swing at your psyche with a big ol’ barbed-wire baseball bat. Each time it connects, it rips a chunk out of you. Small one’s at first, but then the flesh begins to weaken and the damage gets greater with every swing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And once the beating begins, it can be impossible to stop. Soon, you’re curled up on your bed, on the floor, or in the bathroom, weeping your eyes out and hating yourself. Really hating yourself. Or at least, that’s usually how I end up. Why do I have to be like this? Why do I have to think the things that I do? Why can’t I control my own thoughts? Why am I constantly drawn to the negative? Why can’t I be stronger? Why am I such a fucking weakling? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said, the anxiety inevitably turns to self-loathing and then the really bad shit starts coming. The hatred. The desire to feel something, anything, beyond the crippling despair. Suddenly you’re looking in the mirror with a razor blade in hand, eyes ablaze with desperation. I don’t think I’ve ever actually tried to kill myself. But I’ve come close. The thoughts are there. And they are beautiful, in that moment. That’s what makes them so dangerous. When you’ve sunk to the bottom, surrounded by the acid of your own poisonous thoughts, death has an appeal that cannot be understood by someone on the outside. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve undergone these tortures. And I’m deeply ashamed of them. I don’t wear my weakness proudly, like some do. I don’t tote my imperfections so that others may sympathize. Please don’t sympathize. Don’t feel empathy for me. That’ll only make things worse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m &lt;em&gt;pathetic&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scoff if you want, but don’t empathize with me. I’d rather you damn me for being an emotional wreck. I can take that. I get it. Not everyone is like this. It’s often viewed as immature, attention seeking, or just plain weak. Maybe it is? Who knows. Who knows why we’re the way we are. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So who gives a fuck, right? Boo-hoo. Poor me. What’s this got to do with anything, right? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, unfortunately, this has to do with everything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the body of black and gold. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;         +&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I paced my living room, hand absently tapping my leg. My mind was racing and it was bad, I knew it was bad, but the cork had been removed hours ago. What was she doing right now? Who was she talking to? Was she thinking about me? Did she ever think about me? I stopped pacing and checked my phone. It stared back at me, blankly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I huffed a frustrated sigh and started pacing again. I knew I needed to stop, knew I needed to calm down, but I just couldn’t. I was deep in it tonight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t matter, you know it doesn’t matter,” I growled suddenly, “Who the hell cares? You know she loves you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I did know. Sophia loved me unconditionally. She was wonderful, the best girlfriend I could have ever dreamed of. And she didn’t deserve my paranoid insecurities. She didn’t deserve to hear them, see them, or even know they existed. This was my own shit, concocted by an emotionally abused mind. And I would be goddamned if I let it ruin our wonderful relationship. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, the disease persisted. Some days were worse than others. Tonight, it was worse. I sat down on my couch and gripped my phone with boths hands. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Stop thinking about her,” I hissed, “Stop thinking about what she’s doing. You’re going insane.” I looked down at my phone, “No,” I whispered, “Don’t text her either. You’re going to sound desperate and weak.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sophia was a fairly recent addition to my life. A beautiful, smart, amazing addition. We had started to date a couple months ago and had fallen hopelessly in love since. Things were perfect with her. Things were incredible. She was funny, smart, gorgeous, motivated, and incredibly compassionate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complete opposite of the nightmare ex’s that had instilled and imprinted this awful anxiety and paranoia I now hosted. The creeping feeling that something would go wrong, something had to go wrong, things always went wrong. And what would I do then? How would it make me feel? How would I react? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Shut up,” I begged, clutching my head, “Please just shut up.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if I found out she had cheated on me? What if I found out she had kissed someone else? Would that be enough to end it? Is that a forgivable offense? What if she was kissing someone else right now? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“SHUT THE FUCK UP!” I screamed suddenly, eyes bulging, “PLEASE STOP IT!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the disease was hot tonight. It was horny. It was ready to bend me over and fuck me until I was completely spent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh my god, you’re pathetic,” I spat, pacing again, “You have no reason to fear ANY of this! Get a fucking GRIP, man!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She’d leave me. She would absolutely leave me. Especially once she saw this behavior. This psycho display of unjustified, insecure anxiety. Who wouldn’t? This wasn’t something someone should have to deal with, especially when it was completely unwarrented. And that’s what made it all the more frustrating. Because she was incredible. So why was my mind torturing me with this bullshit? There wasn’t a red flag in sight, just the fluttering mast of my own sinking ship. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Just turn off,” I pleaded with my mind, “Just turn off and leave me alone. Please.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They all cheated. They were all attention seekers. She was probably out somewhere right now, pawing drinks off some guy that wasn’t me. But I would never know. Not until it was too late. Isn’t that was the others had done? Isn’t that what they all did? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“LEAVE ME ALONE!” I screamed, head splitting, “SHE’S NOT LIKE THAT AND YOU FUCKING KNOW IT!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fell to my knees, gasping, tears forming in the corners of my eyes. I could practically hear my mind laughing at me. And why shouldn’t it? It was crushing me. This wasn’t a battle, this was a mental slaughtering. I was so deeply afraid and ashamed of myself. Why couldn’t I stop? These were the worries of a child. An insecure, little boy. A horribly conditioned little boy. One who saw a belt and thought “pain” instead of “pants”. My fingers dug into my skull, tore at it, clawed at it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to text her so bad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I turned my phone off. Nothing good would come of it. I needed to learn to deal with this shit on my own. If I reached out to her, my fears would be obvious. She didn’t deserve to see that. I had constructed these fears and I needed to learn how to tear them down on my own. There’s no reason to be afraid of shadows you project on the wall. You can see your hands, you can see the shapes they’re making. You know the shadows are of your own doing. You know they’re not really the monsters your fingers contort them to be. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, they terrified me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I clutched my face. Pain flared behind my eyes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like they were filling up with something. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;         +&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peace swirled through me like a fuzzy mist. I had seen her earlier today. Sophia. She always calmed me. Consumed me. Filled me with confidence. She pushed away the fears and I knew they wouldn’t be back for a couple days. She had the power to do that. I prayed that one day, mercifully, she’d have to power to destroy that part of me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew that was on me, though. Only I could rid myself of the staggering anxiety that assaulted me on an almost daily basis. The irrational, intrusive bullshit that plucked and picked at my mind without an ounce of evidence or fact. Some days, I wondered if I’d be happier if I were single again. Without fail, the thought made me want to vomit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rolled over on my bed and checked the clock. It was almost midnight. I was tired. Tired and thankful I was being spared an onslaught of paranoia tonight. I would sleep well. Just like I always did when I got to see her. I closed my eyes and pictured her face. Her beautiful, perfect face. The way she smiled. The way she smiled at me. There was such care and kindness in the way she did that. That special smile reserved just for me. How could I fear against something so pure? So true? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Because you’re a lunatic,” I muttered, feeling sleep approach. “And you got bags and bags of shit clogging your stupid mind.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just the thought of all that, all the trauma I had gone through in my life, made me wince. My face burned. I felt pressure behind my eyes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like they were filling up with something. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;         +&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew it was going to be a bad day. I could feel it in the back of my throat as soon as my alarm clock went off. I sat up in bed, rubbed my eyes, and already felt a weight in my chest. My mind buzzed, like it had been preparing for my awakening with great anticipation. I tried to block everything out, if only for a moment, if only so that I could scrub my surroundings into focus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did Sophia even like me? Maybe she was just using me to get over something. Maybe when I wasn’t around, she had a completely separate life. One that I wasn’t a part of or even aware of. Maybe she laughed about me with her friends, the fragile, emotionally unsettled loser? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh my god, please don’t start,” I begged weakly, “Don’t start with this shit already.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was my day off. I wouldn’t even have a distraction today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked over at my alarm clock. Why had I set the stupid thing? Habit? I wanted to go back to sleep, but the furnace of thought was already roaring. I slumped back down onto my pillow. I closed my eyes. Why was this starting already? Why did I wake up like this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re pathetic. You have a perfect girlfriend who loves you to death and you spend half your time wondering how it’s going to go to hell. Is that what you want? Is that how you want to remember your time together in these early months? Why don’t you fucking man up, grow a goddamn pair, and stop being such a weepy eyed little bitch. How about that? Can you handle that, cupcake? You fucking fragile flower you? Jesus, why don’t you write it all down in your little diary so you don’t forget, yeah? Why don’t you write a poem about how sad you feel. Then you can mail it to “FuckOff-ville” where all the emotional wrecks go. They can start building you a house and you can move there. You weak, pathetic, frowny-faced fuck. Christ, I mean what is WRONG with you? You know what? You DO deserve to be alone. You don’t deserve her. You don’t deserve anything. Fuck you. Yeah, I said it. Fuck. You. Why don’t you kill yourself? Spare the world your sad little bitch tears and just fucking kill yourself. Just walk into the bathroom and fucking slice your wrists open. What a cliched piece of shit that’d be, huh? The abused disaster finally ends it in a dramatic blood bath. It’s almost hilarious if it wasn’t so fucking disgusting. Christ, are you crying? Are you fucking crying? Get a grip on yourself, I mean Jesus H. Harold. You think crying is going to fix your shit? You think sniveling like a little baby is going to make things better? Go fucking die. How can you stand yourself? You have so many good things going for you and you’re fucking curled up crying over some MADE UP SHIT!? You sir, are insane, unwell, weak-willed, and fucking useless to everyone. Why are you still in bed? Get the fuck up, go to the fucking bathroom, look yourself in the mirror, and fucking say goodbye. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I clutched my head, the pain, overwhelming. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t breathe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My eyes burned. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like they were filling up with something. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;         +&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sophia was on a business trip. She had been gone for three days and I was dying. I sat in my car, face in my hands, and tried to steady myself. Work was over for the day. It was just me now. Me and my empty, quiet apartment. Alone with my thoughts. My cancerous thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, my mind was racing. It pummeled me from all sides with every possible scenario. Every awful, terrible fear I had. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew it was self made. I knew it was all in my head. I knew it was all just my cruel imagination. So why couldn’t I control it? Why the hell was I so powerless against it? I thought again about all the horrible shit I had gone through in my younger years. I thought about all the malicious cunts I had dated and all the terrible, abusive shit they put me through. I thought about how they use to make me feel. About the things they’d say to me. I thought about how they would leave for days when things got bad. How they’d come back in someone else’s clothes. About how they’d lie to my face and expect me to just eat their shit. And I did. Christ, did I ever. I thought about how they’d throw things at me, scream, hit me, spit on me, laugh at me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I curled my fists at the thought. It was a goddamn miracle I didn’t kill those fucking animals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You know they made you like this,” I muttered. “You know you’re afraid because of them.” Just saying it out loud helped a little. “Don’t let them ruin this amazing thing you have. Sophia doesn’t deserve that. You don’t deserve that. Don’t let them control your future because of what they did to you in the past. Fuck them. Right? Yeah. Fuck them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got out of my car and walked inside, feeling slightly better. As closed the door behind me and tossed my keys to the counter, I felt my phone buzz. A text message. I pulled it out and saw it was a text from Sophia. Smiling, I opened it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It read: “That’s hilarious, I’m looking forward to it! See you soon!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confused, I responded: “Looking forward to what? You coming home earlier?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grinned at the thought. What a wonderful surprise that would be. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buzz buzz. New message. I opened it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oops, sorry babe, I sent that to you by accident. Love you!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stared at the screen, feeling my heart sink into my stomach. Who...who had this been intended for? Who was she meeting up with?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Claws closed over my mind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No, stop it,” I said quietly, “don’t start. It’s probably just a work friend and they’re getting a drink together or something. No harm. It might not even be a guy. Even if it is, who cares? People do that all the time, right? Nothing weird or suspicious about that. I trust her.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But did I trust the person she was meeting? Sophia was an extremely attractive woman. Men were drawn to her, without fail. Not only was she beautiful, but she was fun. And smart. And loved to talk to people. What if this guy started pumping drinks into her? What if she started drunkenly flirting with him? A hand here, a look there, a whisper, a chuckle, a kiss on the cheek. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“STOP IT!” I screamed, roared, throwing my phone across the room, “I DON’T WANT TO BE LIKE THIS SO PLEASE JUST FUCKING STOP IT! GODDAMN IT, PLEASE!” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My head ached, my vision spun, and there was an awful pressure behind my eyes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like they were filling up with something. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She’s probably going to flirt with them. Why not? You’re not there to see it. What’s the harm in a little flirting? It doesn’t have to mean anything. Until it does. Until she’s leaving you for him. Isn’t that what they all do? Every man, woman, and piece of shit that infects this world? They’re all just a bunch of slimy, disgusting, slithering monsters. A conglomeration of selfish, blood-sucking vampires that are out to drain anyone who gets near to them. They bring you in, hug you close, and then sink their teeth into you. But you won’t know it until you’re almost dead. Until your blood is almost gone. Until you see their fangs and know it’s too late. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“THAT’S NOT WHAT I THINK!” I howled. “STOP THINKING THAT! I DON’T WANT THIS! GO AWAY!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck you, you pathetic pussy. Can’t you handle your own thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“FUCK OFF!” I screamed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suddenly slammed my face into the wall, hard, bringing stars. It was just enough to falter the flow of poison, if only for a moment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it came back. It always came back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can’t you be like everyone else? Why can’t you think rationally like everyone else? Why can’t you just be happy? Why do you overthink fucking everything? Why can’t you get over your own bullshit? The fuck is wrong with you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“SHUT-UP!” I cried, slamming my face into the wall once more. I tasted blood on my tongue as my nose bounced off the hard surface. The shocking pain brought tears. I felt them overflow and spill down my cheeks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that was all it took. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I slumped down onto the floor and covered my face with my hands. I cried, shoulders shaking, defeated, broken, empty, and alone. I was so deeply ashamed of myself that I wanted to die. I just wanted to fucking die and empty myself of this vicious hell. I didn’t deserve anyone. I didn’t deserve happiness. How could anyone be expected to put up with this circus of madness? This insecure, wrecked, sniveling pile of flesh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cries crawled from my throat and I curled up onto the floor, unable to stop. It was all so meaningless. I would never get better. This would never end. I had been molded into this pathetic excuse of a person and there was no escaping it. I couldn’t fix myself. I couldn’t change the way I thought. I could only cope and cope and cope until I couldn’t cope any longer. There was an end to this road and that end was dark and full of death. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Fuck this,” I wept, crawling to my knees. I wiped my eyes miserably and staggered into the bathroom. My whimpers echoed off the tile and filled my head, a reminder of what a weak, hopeless human being I was. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reached for the medicine cabinet and retrieved my razor. I ripped the plastic head off and held up the slim blade. I stared at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I stared past it, into the mirror, into my own eyes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Horror ripped through me like a bullet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What...the fuck?” I sputtered, leaning towards the mirror. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whites of my eyes had gone completely black. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My iris’s glowed gold. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specks of that same gold slithered through the midnight scleras. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What is happening to me?” I croaked, pulling my eyelid up to examine the terrifying transformation. I rolled my eyes in their sockets to examine the change. Black and gold. Forever, black and gold. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I raised a finger and pressed it against the bags beneath my eyes. I winced and recoiled, pain shuddering through me. There was an immense pressure around my eyes, the skin tight and pregnant with fluid. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I blinked at my reflection, my golden eyes swallowed around a mouthful of ebony. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked down at the razor blade in my hand. I gingerly prodded the skin around my eyes with my other hand. Something was in there. Something was beneath the flesh. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slowly, I raised the razor to my face and placed the blade beneath my left eye. Slowly, I began to part the skin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I moaned painfully as fluid began to release. Thick, tar-like ooze drizzled down my cheek as I separated the skin. Hesitantly, I dabbed it with my finger and raised it to my eyes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I almost screamed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fluid rose up on my finger and squirmed with life of its own. And then it began to foam and grow. It puffed up like it was a stormcloud filling with rain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panicking, I flicked it away into the bathtub. It landed with a splat and continued to foam. When it reached the size of a baseball, it stopped expanding. I got down on my knees, eye still oozing, and watched. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The black orb split along the top and suddenly, the alien mass began to whisper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Kill me...please...kill...me…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recoiled and stood back up, “What the fuck…?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked into the mirror. The flow of oily pus had stopped. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to my amazement, I felt a little better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I switched hands and brought the razor up to my other eye. Slowly, I began to carve the flesh around the other socket. More pus vomited from the cut, a gurgling flow that I caught in my hand and placed in the bathtub. The mass foamed once more and grew bigger. More mouths formed and began to whisper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Useless...kill me...pathetic...sad...very sad…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My voice grated across my teeth, “Are you the one that’s been torturing me?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No good...alone...isolated...sabotage…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Shut up,” I cried, “Just shut the hell up.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Kill...end...finish...useless…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“SHUT UP!” I screamed. I sliced the razor at the mass of foaming substance and it shuddered, a whimper escaping the many mouths. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s when an idea bloomed in my exhausted mind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spun back to the mirror. Breathing heavily, I began to carve up my face. Ooze poured from a dozen different lacerations and I collected it all. I gathered it off my face and flung it into the bathtub to conjoin with the rest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I thought I had enough, I tossed the razor aside. The ruined flesh on my face burned fiercely, but I paid no mind to it. I chanced a single glance back into the mirror and my glowing golden eyes stared back. But they weren’t as bright as they use to be. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got to my knees and plunged my hands into the goo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I began to shape it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First the legs. Then the arms. Then the head. The shit was like putty and when I was finished, I stepped away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched the wriggling body, a golden flaked mass of pitch black darkness. It flopped and called out to me, a hundred odd mouths whispering poison and loathing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cast my hatred down upon it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I went to the hardware store. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;       +&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know how many hours had passed. I sat against the far wall of the bathroom, an array of blackened tools splayed out before me. I had started with the hammer. And then the pliers. And then the pick axe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had smashed, cut, stabbed, burned, sliced, and mutilated the abomination in my tub dozens of times over. And each time it died, I had revived the razor and emptied myself of the poison. Each time I had re-molded the figure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I got to work once more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sweat coated my body. My discarded shirt lay stained and soaked through on the tile. My hair clung wetly to my forehead. I gasped down air. My muscles burned from the torture. Oh, how it had screamed…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slowly, weakly, I stood. I looked into the mirror one last time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I barely recognized myself beneath the mutilation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my eyes were my own once again.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;
                                            [selftext] => Have you ever hated yourself? I’m not talking about minor frustrations with your character. I’m talking about really fucking *hating* yourself. When you just bubble up inside with the most venomous self-loathing madness to the point where you inflict self harm, consider suicide, or even try to kill yourself? Hopefully not many of you have experienced that. 
     

Anxiety is a bitch. That’s usually how it starts. It’s an unsuspecting shadow that creeps up on you and begins to swing at your psyche with a big ol’ barbed-wire baseball bat. Each time it connects, it rips a chunk out of you. Small one’s at first, but then the flesh begins to weaken and the damage gets greater with every swing. 
     

And once the beating begins, it can be impossible to stop. Soon, you’re curled up on your bed, on the floor, or in the bathroom, weeping your eyes out and hating yourself. Really hating yourself. Or at least, that’s usually how I end up. Why do I have to be like this? Why do I have to think the things that I do? Why can’t I control my own thoughts? Why am I constantly drawn to the negative? Why can’t I be stronger? Why am I such a fucking weakling? 
       

Like I said, the anxiety inevitably turns to self-loathing and then the really bad shit starts coming. The hatred. The desire to feel something, anything, beyond the crippling despair. Suddenly you’re looking in the mirror with a razor blade in hand, eyes ablaze with desperation. I don’t think I’ve ever actually tried to kill myself. But I’ve come close. The thoughts are there. And they are beautiful, in that moment. That’s what makes them so dangerous. When you’ve sunk to the bottom, surrounded by the acid of your own poisonous thoughts, death has an appeal that cannot be understood by someone on the outside. 
       

I’ve undergone these tortures. And I’m deeply ashamed of them. I don’t wear my weakness proudly, like some do. I don’t tote my imperfections so that others may sympathize. Please don’t sympathize. Don’t feel empathy for me. That’ll only make things worse. 
       

I’m *pathetic*. 
       

Scoff if you want, but don’t empathize with me. I’d rather you damn me for being an emotional wreck. I can take that. I get it. Not everyone is like this. It’s often viewed as immature, attention seeking, or just plain weak. Maybe it is? Who knows. Who knows why we’re the way we are. 
       

So who gives a fuck, right? Boo-hoo. Poor me. What’s this got to do with anything, right? 
       

Well, unfortunately, this has to do with everything. 
       

And the body of black and gold. 

+          +

     
I paced my living room, hand absently tapping my leg. My mind was racing and it was bad, I knew it was bad, but the cork had been removed hours ago. What was she doing right now? Who was she talking to? Was she thinking about me? Did she ever think about me? I stopped pacing and checked my phone. It stared back at me, blankly. 
     

I huffed a frustrated sigh and started pacing again. I knew I needed to stop, knew I needed to calm down, but I just couldn’t. I was deep in it tonight. 
     

“It doesn’t matter, you know it doesn’t matter,” I growled suddenly, “Who the hell cares? You know she loves you.”
      

And I did know. Sophia loved me unconditionally. She was wonderful, the best girlfriend I could have ever dreamed of. And she didn’t deserve my paranoid insecurities. She didn’t deserve to hear them, see them, or even know they existed. This was my own shit, concocted by an emotionally abused mind. And I would be goddamned if I let it ruin our wonderful relationship. 
       

And yet, the disease persisted. Some days were worse than others. Tonight, it was worse. I sat down on my couch and gripped my phone with boths hands. 
       

“Stop thinking about her,” I hissed, “Stop thinking about what she’s doing. You’re going insane.” I looked down at my phone, “No,” I whispered, “Don’t text her either. You’re going to sound desperate and weak.”
       

Sophia was a fairly recent addition to my life. A beautiful, smart, amazing addition. We had started to date a couple months ago and had fallen hopelessly in love since. Things were perfect with her. Things were incredible. She was funny, smart, gorgeous, motivated, and incredibly compassionate. 
       

The complete opposite of the nightmare ex’s that had instilled and imprinted this awful anxiety and paranoia I now hosted. The creeping feeling that something would go wrong, something had to go wrong, things always went wrong. And what would I do then? How would it make me feel? How would I react? 
       

“Shut up,” I begged, clutching my head, “Please just shut up.”
       

What if I found out she had cheated on me? What if I found out she had kissed someone else? Would that be enough to end it? Is that a forgivable offense? What if she was kissing someone else right now? 
       

“SHUT THE FUCK UP!” I screamed suddenly, eyes bulging, “PLEASE STOP IT!”
       

But the disease was hot tonight. It was horny. It was ready to bend me over and fuck me until I was completely spent. 
       

“Oh my god, you’re pathetic,” I spat, pacing again, “You have no reason to fear ANY of this! Get a fucking GRIP, man!”
        

She’d leave me. She would absolutely leave me. Especially once she saw this behavior. This psycho display of unjustified, insecure anxiety. Who wouldn’t? This wasn’t something someone should have to deal with, especially when it was completely unwarrented. And that’s what made it all the more frustrating. Because she was incredible. So why was my mind torturing me with this bullshit? There wasn’t a red flag in sight, just the fluttering mast of my own sinking ship. 
       

“Just turn off,” I pleaded with my mind, “Just turn off and leave me alone. Please.”
       

They all cheated. They were all attention seekers. She was probably out somewhere right now, pawing drinks off some guy that wasn’t me. But I would never know. Not until it was too late. Isn’t that was the others had done? Isn’t that what they all did? 
       

“LEAVE ME ALONE!” I screamed, head splitting, “SHE’S NOT LIKE THAT AND YOU FUCKING KNOW IT!”
       

I fell to my knees, gasping, tears forming in the corners of my eyes. I could practically hear my mind laughing at me. And why shouldn’t it? It was crushing me. This wasn’t a battle, this was a mental slaughtering. I was so deeply afraid and ashamed of myself. Why couldn’t I stop? These were the worries of a child. An insecure, little boy. A horribly conditioned little boy. One who saw a belt and thought “pain” instead of “pants”. My fingers dug into my skull, tore at it, clawed at it. 
       

I wanted to text her so bad. 
       

I turned my phone off. Nothing good would come of it. I needed to learn to deal with this shit on my own. If I reached out to her, my fears would be obvious. She didn’t deserve to see that. I had constructed these fears and I needed to learn how to tear them down on my own. There’s no reason to be afraid of shadows you project on the wall. You can see your hands, you can see the shapes they’re making. You know the shadows are of your own doing. You know they’re not really the monsters your fingers contort them to be. 
       

And yet, they terrified me. 
       

I clutched my face. Pain flared behind my eyes. 
       

Like they were filling up with something.

Peace swirled through me like a fuzzy mist. I had seen her earlier today. Sophia. She always calmed me. Consumed me. Filled me with confidence. She pushed away the fears and I knew they wouldn’t be back for a couple days. She had the power to do that. I prayed that one day, mercifully, she’d have to power to destroy that part of me. 
     

I knew that was on me, though. Only I could rid myself of the staggering anxiety that assaulted me on an almost daily basis. The irrational, intrusive bullshit that plucked and picked at my mind without an ounce of evidence or fact. Some days, I wondered if I’d be happier if I were single again. Without fail, the thought made me want to vomit. 
      

I rolled over on my bed and checked the clock. It was almost midnight. I was tired. Tired and thankful I was being spared an onslaught of paranoia tonight. I would sleep well. Just like I always did when I got to see her. I closed my eyes and pictured her face. Her beautiful, perfect face. The way she smiled. The way she smiled at me. There was such care and kindness in the way she did that. That special smile reserved just for me. How could I fear against something so pure? So true? 
      

“Because you’re a lunatic,” I muttered, feeling sleep approach. “And you got bags and bags of shit clogging your stupid mind.”
      

Just the thought of all that, all the trauma I had gone through in my life, made me wince. My face burned. I felt pressure behind my eyes. 
      

Like they were filling up with something.

I knew it was going to be a bad day. I could feel it in the back of my throat as soon as my alarm clock went off. I sat up in bed, rubbed my eyes, and already felt a weight in my chest. My mind buzzed, like it had been preparing for my awakening with great anticipation. I tried to block everything out, if only for a moment, if only so that I could scrub my surroundings into focus. 
      

Did Sophia even like me? Maybe she was just using me to get over something. Maybe when I wasn’t around, she had a completely separate life. One that I wasn’t a part of or even aware of. Maybe she laughed about me with her friends, the fragile, emotionally unsettled loser? 
      

“Oh my god, please don’t start,” I begged weakly, “Don’t start with this shit already.”
     

It was my day off. I wouldn’t even have a distraction today. 
     

I looked over at my alarm clock. Why had I set the stupid thing? Habit? I wanted to go back to sleep, but the furnace of thought was already roaring. I slumped back down onto my pillow. I closed my eyes. Why was this starting already? Why did I wake up like this?
      

You’re pathetic. You have a perfect girlfriend who loves you to death and you spend half your time wondering how it’s going to go to hell. Is that what you want? Is that how you want to remember your time together in these early months? Why don’t you fucking man up, grow a goddamn pair, and stop being such a weepy eyed little bitch. How about that? Can you handle that, cupcake? You fucking fragile flower you? Jesus, why don’t you write it all down in your little diary so you don’t forget, yeah? Why don’t you write a poem about how sad you feel. Then you can mail it to “FuckOff-ville” where all the emotional wrecks go. They can start building you a house and you can move there. You weak, pathetic, frowny-faced fuck. Christ, I mean what is WRONG with you? You know what? You DO deserve to be alone. You don’t deserve her. You don’t deserve anything. Fuck you. Yeah, I said it. Fuck. You. Why don’t you kill yourself? Spare the world your sad little bitch tears and just fucking kill yourself. Just walk into the bathroom and fucking slice your wrists open. What a cliched piece of shit that’d be, huh? The abused disaster finally ends it in a dramatic blood bath. It’s almost hilarious if it wasn’t so fucking disgusting. Christ, are you crying? Are you fucking crying? Get a grip on yourself, I mean Jesus H. Harold. You think crying is going to fix your shit? You think sniveling like a little baby is going to make things better? Go fucking die. How can you stand yourself? You have so many good things going for you and you’re fucking curled up crying over some MADE UP SHIT!? You sir, are insane, unwell, weak-willed, and fucking useless to everyone. Why are you still in bed? Get the fuck up, go to the fucking bathroom, look yourself in the mirror, and fucking say goodbye. 
       

I clutched my head, the pain, overwhelming. 
       

I couldn’t breathe. 
       

My eyes burned. 
       
Like they were filling up with something.

Sophia was on a business trip. She had been gone for three days and I was dying. I sat in my car, face in my hands, and tried to steady myself. Work was over for the day. It was just me now. Me and my empty, quiet apartment. Alone with my thoughts. My cancerous thoughts. 
      

As usual, my mind was racing. It pummeled me from all sides with every possible scenario. Every awful, terrible fear I had. 
      

I knew it was self made. I knew it was all in my head. I knew it was all just my cruel imagination. So why couldn’t I control it? Why the hell was I so powerless against it? I thought again about all the horrible shit I had gone through in my younger years. I thought about all the malicious cunts I had dated and all the terrible, abusive shit they put me through. I thought about how they use to make me feel. About the things they’d say to me. I thought about how they would leave for days when things got bad. How they’d come back in someone else’s clothes. About how they’d lie to my face and expect me to just eat their shit. And I did. Christ, did I ever. I thought about how they’d throw things at me, scream, hit me, spit on me, laugh at me. 
      

I curled my fists at the thought. It was a goddamn miracle I didn’t kill those fucking animals. 
      

“You know they made you like this,” I muttered. “You know you’re afraid because of them.” Just saying it out loud helped a little. “Don’t let them ruin this amazing thing you have. Sophia doesn’t deserve that. You don’t deserve that. Don’t let them control your future because of what they did to you in the past. Fuck them. Right? Yeah. Fuck them.”
      

I got out of my car and walked inside, feeling slightly better. As closed the door behind me and tossed my keys to the counter, I felt my phone buzz. A text message. I pulled it out and saw it was a text from Sophia. Smiling, I opened it. 
      

It read: “That’s hilarious, I’m looking forward to it! See you soon!”
      

Confused, I responded: “Looking forward to what? You coming home earlier?”
      

I grinned at the thought. What a wonderful surprise that would be. 
      

Buzz buzz. New message. I opened it. 
      

“Oops, sorry babe, I sent that to you by accident. Love you!”
      

I stared at the screen, feeling my heart sink into my stomach. Who...who had this been intended for? Who was she meeting up with?
      

Claws closed over my mind. 
      

“No, stop it,” I said quietly, “don’t start. It’s probably just a work friend and they’re getting a drink together or something. No harm. It might not even be a guy. Even if it is, who cares? People do that all the time, right? Nothing weird or suspicious about that. I trust her.”
       

But did I trust the person she was meeting? Sophia was an extremely attractive woman. Men were drawn to her, without fail. Not only was she beautiful, but she was fun. And smart. And loved to talk to people. What if this guy started pumping drinks into her? What if she started drunkenly flirting with him? A hand here, a look there, a whisper, a chuckle, a kiss on the cheek. 
       

“STOP IT!” I screamed, roared, throwing my phone across the room, “I DON’T WANT TO BE LIKE THIS SO PLEASE JUST FUCKING STOP IT! GODDAMN IT, PLEASE!” 
       

My head ached, my vision spun, and there was an awful pressure behind my eyes. 
       

Like they were filling up with something. 
       

She’s probably going to flirt with them. Why not? You’re not there to see it. What’s the harm in a little flirting? It doesn’t have to mean anything. Until it does. Until she’s leaving you for him. Isn’t that what they all do? Every man, woman, and piece of shit that infects this world? They’re all just a bunch of slimy, disgusting, slithering monsters. A conglomeration of selfish, blood-sucking vampires that are out to drain anyone who gets near to them. They bring you in, hug you close, and then sink their teeth into you. But you won’t know it until you’re almost dead. Until your blood is almost gone. Until you see their fangs and know it’s too late. 
        

“THAT’S NOT WHAT I THINK!” I howled. “STOP THINKING THAT! I DON’T WANT THIS! GO AWAY!”
         

Fuck you, you pathetic pussy. Can’t you handle your own thoughts?
         

“FUCK OFF!” I screamed. 
         

I suddenly slammed my face into the wall, hard, bringing stars. It was just enough to falter the flow of poison, if only for a moment. 
         

But it came back. It always came back. 
         

What can’t you be like everyone else? Why can’t you think rationally like everyone else? Why can’t you just be happy? Why do you overthink fucking everything? Why can’t you get over your own bullshit? The fuck is wrong with you?
          

“SHUT-UP!” I cried, slamming my face into the wall once more. I tasted blood on my tongue as my nose bounced off the hard surface. The shocking pain brought tears. I felt them overflow and spill down my cheeks. 
        

And that was all it took. 
        

I slumped down onto the floor and covered my face with my hands. I cried, shoulders shaking, defeated, broken, empty, and alone. I was so deeply ashamed of myself that I wanted to die. I just wanted to fucking die and empty myself of this vicious hell. I didn’t deserve anyone. I didn’t deserve happiness. How could anyone be expected to put up with this circus of madness? This insecure, wrecked, sniveling pile of flesh?
       

Cries crawled from my throat and I curled up onto the floor, unable to stop. It was all so meaningless. I would never get better. This would never end. I had been molded into this pathetic excuse of a person and there was no escaping it. I couldn’t fix myself. I couldn’t change the way I thought. I could only cope and cope and cope until I couldn’t cope any longer. There was an end to this road and that end was dark and full of death. 
       

“Fuck this,” I wept, crawling to my knees. I wiped my eyes miserably and staggered into the bathroom. My whimpers echoed off the tile and filled my head, a reminder of what a weak, hopeless human being I was. 
       

I reached for the medicine cabinet and retrieved my razor. I ripped the plastic head off and held up the slim blade. I stared at it.
       

And then I stared past it, into the mirror, into my own eyes. 
      

Horror ripped through me like a bullet. 
      

“What...the fuck?” I sputtered, leaning towards the mirror. 
      

The whites of my eyes had gone completely black. 
      

My iris’s glowed gold. 
      

Specks of that same gold slithered through the midnight scleras. 
      

“What is happening to me?” I croaked, pulling my eyelid up to examine the terrifying transformation. I rolled my eyes in their sockets to examine the change. Black and gold. Forever, black and gold. 
      

I raised a finger and pressed it against the bags beneath my eyes. I winced and recoiled, pain shuddering through me. There was an immense pressure around my eyes, the skin tight and pregnant with fluid. 
      

I blinked at my reflection, my golden eyes swallowed around a mouthful of ebony. 
      

I looked down at the razor blade in my hand. I gingerly prodded the skin around my eyes with my other hand. Something was in there. Something was beneath the flesh. 
      

Slowly, I raised the razor to my face and placed the blade beneath my left eye. Slowly, I began to part the skin. 
      

I moaned painfully as fluid began to release. Thick, tar-like ooze drizzled down my cheek as I separated the skin. Hesitantly, I dabbed it with my finger and raised it to my eyes. 
      

I almost screamed. 
      

The fluid rose up on my finger and squirmed with life of its own. And then it began to foam and grow. It puffed up like it was a stormcloud filling with rain. 
      

Panicking, I flicked it away into the bathtub. It landed with a splat and continued to foam. When it reached the size of a baseball, it stopped expanding. I got down on my knees, eye still oozing, and watched. 
      

The black orb split along the top and suddenly, the alien mass began to whisper. 
      

“Kill me...please...kill...me…”
      

I recoiled and stood back up, “What the fuck…?”
      

I looked into the mirror. The flow of oily pus had stopped. 
      

And to my amazement, I felt a little better. 
      

I switched hands and brought the razor up to my other eye. Slowly, I began to carve the flesh around the other socket. More pus vomited from the cut, a gurgling flow that I caught in my hand and placed in the bathtub. The mass foamed once more and grew bigger. More mouths formed and began to whisper. 
      

“Useless...kill me...pathetic...sad...very sad…”
      

My voice grated across my teeth, “Are you the one that’s been torturing me?”
      

“No good...alone...isolated...sabotage…”
      

“Shut up,” I cried, “Just shut the hell up.”
      

“Kill...end...finish...useless…”
      

“SHUT UP!” I screamed. I sliced the razor at the mass of foaming substance and it shuddered, a whimper escaping the many mouths. 
       

And that’s when an idea bloomed in my exhausted mind. 
       

I spun back to the mirror. Breathing heavily, I began to carve up my face. Ooze poured from a dozen different lacerations and I collected it all. I gathered it off my face and flung it into the bathtub to conjoin with the rest. 
       

When I thought I had enough, I tossed the razor aside. The ruined flesh on my face burned fiercely, but I paid no mind to it. I chanced a single glance back into the mirror and my glowing golden eyes stared back. But they weren’t as bright as they use to be. 
        

I got to my knees and plunged my hands into the goo. 
        

And then I began to shape it. 
        

First the legs. Then the arms. Then the head. The shit was like putty and when I was finished, I stepped away. 
        

I watched the wriggling body, a golden flaked mass of pitch black darkness. It flopped and called out to me, a hundred odd mouths whispering poison and loathing. 
        

I cast my hatred down upon it. 
        

And then I went to the hardware store. 


+        +

        

I don’t know how many hours had passed. I sat against the far wall of the bathroom, an array of blackened tools splayed out before me. I had started with the hammer. And then the pliers. And then the pick axe. 
        

I had smashed, cut, stabbed, burned, sliced, and mutilated the abomination in my tub dozens of times over. And each time it died, I had revived the razor and emptied myself of the poison. Each time I had re-molded the figure. 
        

And then I got to work once more. 
        

Sweat coated my body. My discarded shirt lay stained and soaked through on the tile. My hair clung wetly to my forehead. I gasped down air. My muscles burned from the torture. Oh, how it had screamed…
         

Slowly, weakly, I stood. I looked into the mirror one last time. 
         

I barely recognized myself beneath the mutilation. 
         

But my eyes were my own once again.

I mean, I thought it was just some stupid myth that theater kids were obsessed with. I wasn’t even a theater kid myself, I was only helping out with the productions because I needed an elective credit last minute and this was the only class that wasn’t full. So, of course, I didn’t take it seriously when Mr. Luevanos said we were doing the “Scottish curse” play. I had no idea what that was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s Macbeth,” Jenny Holland said in her snobby voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So why didn’t you just say, Macbeth?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire class rolled their eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Because, you idiot, it’s the Scottish curse. Saying the name inside the theater causes disaster,” she replied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re not even in the theater,” I pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jenny rolled her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first showing of the play was about two months after that. Jenny was playing Lady Macbeth and she was being a real bitch about it. Acting like we should have been kissing her feet and throwing ourselves on the floor so she could march across our backs. So, right before she was about to go onstage I did it. I was just mad and annoyed. So, I was standing there, waiting for my cue to open the curtains when I said it. Well, whispered. I didn’t want any theater geeks to hear me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Macbeth,” I mumbled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I froze, they had all gotten inside my head and I almost expected the entire auditorium to collapse. But, Lo and behold, nothing happened. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Macbeth, Macbeth, Macbeth,” I chanted to myself as I opened the curtain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing happened. At all. I was almost disappointed. Not that I wanted to be responsible for a huge tragedy, but I at least expected someone to slip and fall on stage, or at least forget their lines. But no such luck. So, we cleaned up the stage, put everything back how it was, and went home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning we got the word. Jenny Holland had killed herself. Taken a bunch of pills, slit her wrists and laid in her bathtub. Her twelve-year-old sister had found her. Everyone was shocked, Jenny certainly never showed any signs of being suicidal or depressed. It was so unlike her. I thought back to the night before, chanting “Macbeth” and I thought maybe it was my fault. But it couldn&amp;#39;t be, right? It was just some stupid myth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I tested it again. Yes, we kept the show dates going. We had already rented out the auditorium for a total of five days, and we had to do it. This time, Iris Paul took the part of Lady Macbeth. She was less of a bitch. Anthony Rivers, however, was being a real dick that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He wasn’t a very big fan of Jenny, and he kept talking about how much more peaceful school would be now that she was dead. I wasn’t a big fan of Jenny either but come on man, give it a few months before you start saying shit like that. I was on curtain duty again and I watched Anthony walking around the stage, saying his Macbeth lines. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He’s not even a good Macbeth,” I mumbled. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That time it was an accident- I swear. I didn’t purposely say it. I wanted to make sure, anyway. I wanted to make sure that saying Macbeth wasn’t what had killed Jenny. So, if no one died tonight, her death wasn’t my fault. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except that isn’t what happened. Anthony got jumped on his driveway and stabbed to death while he was fighting his attacker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We canceled the rest of the show dates after that.We had a memorial for Jenny and Anthony instead. At the memorial, Gina Davis came up to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Don’t you think it’s weird that Jenny and Anthony died the same way that their characters did?” she asked me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You know, Lady Macbeth committed suicide, and Macbeth was killed in combat,”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t know. I hadn’t really paid attention to the play, as my only job was raising and lowering curtains. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that was when I realized what I had done. I had killed them. Not directly, but it was my fault. And the thing was, I didn’t feel bad. I actually felt powerful. So, a few weeks ago, when Gina Davis told my girlfriend that she had seen me hanging out with Gwyn Kremp, I walked into the auditorium. We weren’t doing the play anymore, but I wanted to see if it would work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stood in the middle of the stage and shouted&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Macbeth!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It felt good to shout. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I waited. Not long though. Gina Davis fell down a flight of stairs on her way to science class and hit her head on a sharp piece on what once was a pole, which was still sticking out of the ground at the bottom. She didn’t have a roll in the play, she was in charge of the costumes and props. At least now I knew it didn’t just work on the cast. But who to target next?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually haven’t had time to go after someone else though, I started having nightmares. Really, really vivid ones. I was in some sort of cave, and I couldn’t see anything, just kept hearing voices. Something else happened as well. I became captain of the lacrosse team. It was sudden and weird. The old captain, Dallas Blake, had just stepped down and given me the spot. I was confused at first, but hey, I’m not going to complain about being captain of the lacrosse team. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what got into me after that, but I wanted more. Having the power to kill people who merely pissed me off without the possibility of getting caught was great, being captain of the lacrosse team was great, but I wanted more. I wanted to be captain of the soccer team. It wasn’t a school team, it was something I did on my own time, and the coach had made his son captain (yay favoritism). I needed that spot. Something told me that I needed it, that I deserved it. So, one day when I was driving home from the library, I saw the coach’s son Adam crossing an otherwise empty street. I don’t know what came over me. I stepped on the gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adam went flying onto the top of my car and then rolled off when I hit the breaks. He was dead, I could just tell. So I backed up my car and went around him and drove home. Soccer practice was canceled for about two weeks after that, but when we got back to it, I got Adam’s title. Team captain. Sure, I had to murder him to get it but hey, I had gotten it right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the visions started. They started with Jenny. I kept seeing her out of the corner of my eye. The first few times she appeared, I couldn’t really get a good look at her. Every time I would turn in her direction she&amp;#39;d vanish, and I’d be convinced that I had gone crazy. But there was also no mistaking her fiery red hair. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After about a week of her ghost or whatever hanging out in my peripheral, I finally ended up seeing her one day. I was about to get in the bath. I had grabbed the bag of Epsom salt and walked over, about to pour it into the water, when I looked down and there she was. She was in my fucking bathtub, staring up at me from under the steaming water. Her face was hollow and her eyes were wide and haunting. It was like she didn’t even have eyelids. Her hair was floating around her, Medusa-like. Then I noticed the water was turning pink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her wrists were bleeding. The blood was oozing out, thick and deep red, like a lava lamp. (If said lava lamp was attached to a bleeding dead person that is). She started talking. Not out loud. Her lips never moved, but I could hear her voice in my head. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Nought’s had, all’s spent, where our desire is got without content,”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pretty much figured that it was some sort of line from the play, and I didn’t really have the time to play riddles with a corpse, so I poured in the salt, hoping she would disappear. But she didn’t. Instead, she sat up and grabbed my arm, her fingers blue and cold around my wrist, despite the steaming hot water that she was just in. The room filled with the smell of decay. I gagged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She tilted her head to the side, like a confused dog, and then just kept tilting until her chin was almost where her forehead should have been. The smell of decay became stronger and I tried to pull away but her grip was like steel. When I felt like I was being suffocated by the smell of death, she finally let go and disappeared back into the water. I took deep breaths, trying to get rid of the smell which was now permanently stuck in my nostrils. I leaned over the tub and looked into the water. She was gone, but the water was still pink with blood. I reached my arm into the tub to drain it and I froze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My skin was decaying. It was black and purple, pieces of it hanging off on my wrist where Jenny had grabbed me. I swear I could almost see the bone. It was disgusting, but not as much as the smell which I now realized was coming from my arm. So, I did the only thing I could do in this situation. I wrapped up my decaying arm with bandages. I figured that would have to do, and it was some sort of hallucination from being so tired after soccer practice earlier. So I ditched my bath and went to bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week later I saw Anthony. He was leaning over me when I woke up. His face was all cut up and I almost didn’t recognize him, but one of his blue eyes was still distinguishable through the blood that covered his face. He had stab wounds in his neck, cheeks, and even the other eye. His head had obviously been bashed in, his right temple was dented in an odd, almost fake way. And he was dripping blood onto me. I laid there as he stared at me and I stared at him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Will all great Neptune’s ocean wash this blood clean from my hands?” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was it with these corpses and their cryptic messages? I didn’t really have time to think about that because Anthony opened his mouth and a river of what I assumed to be blood and rotting internal organs spilled out over me. When it stopped, I wiped my eyes. His mouth was still open, impossibly wide. I was covered in blood and internal shit. Then he wrapped his bloody hands around my neck and began to strangle me. His hands were the opposite of Jenny. They were extremely hot, like a blow torch being held to the skin. I gasped and gagged at the scent of my burning flesh. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was about to blackout when he stopped and vanished. I sat up in bed and grabbed my throat. Bad idea. It hurt like a motherfucker. I jumped out of bed and ran to the mirror. My whole neck and throat were covered in huge bruises and it hurt to swallow. How the fuck was I going to hide this? Or explain it for that matter? I couldn’t exactly go to the emergency room. How was I going to explain third-degree burns on my neck? So, I did the next best thing: I slathered some Neosporin on it and hoped for the best. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next came Gina. She showed up, bruised but not bloody, with a huge gash in the side of her head. I braced myself, thinking she was probably going to hit me with a two by four or something. But no, that bitch reached out and squeezed my neck. I screamed with all my might at the pain. I could feel all the blisters popping and the contents pouring down my neck and onto my shirt. She kept going. Her hands on my burnt skin brought tears to my eyes. I blacked out from the pain and when I came to, she was gone and my arm was missing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not the decaying one, no, that would have been too fucking easy. Instead, she took my good arm and chopped it off at the elbow. I don’t know how the hell a ghost managed to perform an amputation and stitch me back up, but she did. (I was mildly glad that I at least hadn&amp;#39;t gotten some other cryptic Macbeth line.)  I had phantom limb syndrome. I didn’t really know what to do at this point. One of my arms was decaying and the decay was spreading rapidly. The other was gone, my neck was burnt, and there was one person who I hadn’t been visited by yet. Adam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I almost hoped that Adam would show up and just kill me. But no, apparently the universe doesn’t fucking work that way because when he finally did show up, he knocked me out, strapped me down to my kitchen table and cut me open. No anesthesia. I screamed at first, but after he removed one of my kidneys, I was pretty much numb. But I wouldn’t fucking die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He took out both kidneys, my liver, and what I’m pretty sure was my appendix. I watched as he walked over to the stove and cooked them. Then he stood over me as he ate them, his face bruised up, and his left arm pulled out of its socket. When he was done he took out my lungs. I didn’t know how I was still alive. I figured it out really quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My organs were growing back. Adam would cut them out, eat them, and then they would grow back again. He ate them more than ten times. I’m not exactly sure how many times they grew back and got cut out. I lost count after the twelfth time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Adam was done, he haphazardly stitched me up. It took me about ten seconds to realize he had left the knife inside of me. I thought that would be the end of it but it isn’t. They all keep appearing, taking turns. Same injuries, same order, but different forms of torture. Jenny started eating my flesh, Anthony has started burning other parts of my body. Gina had been cutting off my fingers and toes, and Adam has been cutting me open and then sticking random items into me before closing me up again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know how much longer I can live through this, but I can’t die. I’ve tried. I jumped off my roof, slit my throat open, I hung myself from my balcony. Nothing works. I’m stuck here, living this over and over, all because of the stupid Scottish Curse. So please take my advice and whatever you do, do not even mumble that name in the theater. Not unless you want to end up like me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;

I figured it out really quickly.


My organs were growing back. Adam would cut them out, eat them, and then they would grow back again. He ate them more than ten times. I’m not exactly sure how many times they grew back and got cut out. I lost count after the twelfth time. 


When Adam was done, he haphazardly stitched me up. It took me about ten seconds to realize he had left the knife inside of me. I thought that would be the end of it but it isn’t. They all keep appearing, taking turns. Same injuries, same order, but different forms of torture. Jenny started eating my flesh, Anthony has started burning other parts of my body. Gina had been cutting off my fingers and toes, and Adam has been cutting me open and then sticking random items into me before closing me up again.


I don’t know how much longer I can live through this, but I can’t die. I’ve tried. I jumped off my roof, slit my throat open, I hung myself from my balcony. Nothing works. I’m stuck here, living this over and over, all because of the stupid Scottish Curse. So please take my advice and whatever you do, do not even mumble that name in the theater. Not unless you want to end up like me.

My wife and I host a lot of parties, and if you’ve ever done cleanup after a party, you know that people leave things behind. Hats and coats constantly, scarves, purses, whatever. One time I found a pair of prescription glasses stuck in between the couch cushions. They were thick lenses, too, like Velma-thick. I don’t know how the owner made it out of the front door without them, let alone how they drove home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of the time, we’ll get a call the next day or the next week, someone going, “Hey, so, I haven’t seen my jacket lately. Did I leave it at your place?” But sometimes, no one ever claims it. And Jenny and I -- Jenny’s my wife -- we aren’t about to call everyone who was at the party to ask if they’re missing whatever we’ve found. So we just chuck it in a wooden chest we’ve got in the closet and leave it there until someone does come looking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So recently, we had a winter party, and someone left their pants here. Now, it was not that kind of party, so I was pretty surprised to find a pair of pants laying around afterward. They were snow pants, the kind you wear over your other clothes to keep them warm and dry, and they were folded up and stored in a corner. I figured that probably someone had shown up in them to stay warm, then taken them off once they got inside. Between the warmth of the house and the warmth of the alcohol, they must have forgotten to put them back on when they left at the end of the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jenny flipped through her pictures from the evening, but didn’t have any shots of anyone wearing those pants, so into the trunk they went. As Jenny was tossing them in, she commented, “I bet we could clothe a whole person with what’s in here.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We laughed, but then I got to thinking that she was probably right. So later on, I dug through the trunk and sure enough, in addition to the pants we had a button-down shirt, multiple jackets, several hats, a pair of gloves, a couple of scarves and two pairs of shoes. While Jenny was out of the house that night, I put the shirt on a hanger, hung the jacket over it, clipped the gloves to the sleeves and the pants to the bottom, and wrapped a scarf around it. Then I hung the whole thing up in the hallway, plopped a hat on top and put the shoes beneath it. The pants hung just to the ground, so at first glance it really did look like someone lurking there, especially with the lights off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heard the door slam when Jenny got home. She started to call out a greeting, but it abruptly cut off in a shriek. I came into the hallway, laughing, to find Jenny standing there with a hand to her chest, glaring at me. The clothes dummy swung quietly off to the side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Real funny!” she said. “You about gave me a heart attack.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m very sorry,” I said, but I was laughing much too hard for her to believe me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, you will be,” she said, with mock seriousness, but she was laughing too, now that she was past the initial shock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I thought that was all extremely funny right up until I got up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet. I walked into the bathroom, turned on the lights -- and shouted out loud, because Jenny had moved my clothes dummy into the bathroom and posed it sitting on the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the bedroom, I heard sleepy laughter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Do you know what happens when you scare someone who’s on his way to the bathroom?” I demanded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Rags are under the sink. Clean up whatever you need to,” Jenny called back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A lesser man would have to clean up. I have iron self-control,” I told her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Is that why you screamed loudly enough to wake me up?” she teased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t dignify that with a response. Also, I didn’t have one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this became a thing. Jenny and I would move the dummy around, and after a while it wasn’t even to scare each other anymore. We named him Albert, and he was just a feature of the house after a few weeks. We’d put him in the kitchen, the dining room, wherever. I came home a couple of days ago to find the clothes slumped in my chair in front of the TV, with one of my beers in his glove. I just got another beer and took a seat on the couch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jenny came in later and said, “You’re not going to move him?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He was here first,” I shrugged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You’re ridiculous,” Jenny told me, and took Albert’s beer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He’s not going to like that,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jenny laughed. “What’s he going to do about it?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was a couple of days ago, like I said. Yesterday, I came home to find Albert hanging by the picture window at the back of the house. His clothes were splashed with something red, and there was a dripping knife wedged in one of his gloves. It was a pretty gruesome sight, and I applauded Jenny’s ingenuity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Did he get you, honey?” I called. No response, obviously. She wasn’t about to give up the joke that easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hey, the stuff is dripping onto the floor,” I said loudly enough for her to hear me, wherever she was hiding. “I think it’s staining the carpet.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still nothing, so I got a paper towel and wiped up the “blood,” then took Albert’s knife away from him. Whatever Jenny had used really did look like blood, and I was starting to get uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Honey? Okay, you got me. Joke’s over.” Still no response, so I went looking. I went through the entire house, and couldn’t find her anywhere. Her car was out front, but Jenny was just missing. I called her phone, but it rang through to voicemail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When she still hadn’t shown up by midnight, I was starting to get panicked. I’d called a few friends, but no one had heard from her. I decided to get a few hours of sleep and then figure out what to do in the morning. I laid down, turned out the lights and was falling asleep when I heard a slight noise in the hallway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I opened my eyes to see Jenny in the doorway. “Where have you b--” I started, turning on the lights, but my voice died in my throat. It wasn’t Jenny. It was Albert, hanging from the doorway of my room, swaying slightly back and forth above his shoes. The knife was back in his hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My heart was hammering. This was obviously just Jenny taking a joke too far, but when I called out for her again and she didn’t answer, my fear spiked. I took those clothes down, carried them downstairs and even though I knew it was totally illogical, I burned them in the fireplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expected Jenny to come out to laugh at me once I got the fire going, or at least to chide me for stinking up the house -- I don’t know what they pack snow pants with, but it smells terrible when you burn it -- but the fire burned down to ashes and I was still alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I slept for a bit, and when I left for work this morning, there was still no sign of Jenny and she still wasn’t answering her phone. I called the police to report her missing, and they’re supposed to be sending someone over to take a look around and interview me, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope they get here soon. Because I just heard a noise from upstairs, and when I went up to look, the door to our walk-in closet was standing open. Hanging from the bars, aligned in two neat rows, were a dozen of Jenny’s outfits. Shirts on the hangers, pants clipped below, shoes lined up underneath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bedroom door only locks from the inside, but I closed it and used my tie to tie the knob to the banister in the hallway. I was going to leave the house, but there’s a coat rack by the door, and I really don’t think I lined my shoes up underneath it like that when I got home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope the police get here soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;
                                            [selftext] => It started as a joke.

“He’s not going to like that,” I said.

Jenny laughed. “What’s he going to do about it?”

That was a couple of days ago, like I said. Yesterday, I came home to find Albert hanging by the picture window at the back of the house. His clothes were splashed with something red, and there was a dripping knife wedged in one of his gloves. It was a pretty gruesome sight, and I applauded Jenny’s ingenuity.

“Did he get you, honey?” I called. No response, obviously. She wasn’t about to give up the joke that easily.

“Hey, the stuff is dripping onto the floor,” I said loudly enough for her to hear me, wherever she was hiding. “I think it’s staining the carpet.”

Still nothing, so I got a paper towel and wiped up the “blood,” then took Albert’s knife away from him. Whatever Jenny had used really did look like blood, and I was starting to get uncomfortable.

“Honey? Okay, you got me. Joke’s over.” Still no response, so I went looking. I went through the entire house, and couldn’t find her anywhere. Her car was out front, but Jenny was just missing. I called her phone, but it rang through to voicemail.

When she still hadn’t shown up by midnight, I was starting to get panicked. I’d called a few friends, but no one had heard from her. I decided to get a few hours of sleep and then figure out what to do in the morning. I laid down, turned out the lights and was falling asleep when I heard a slight noise in the hallway.

I opened my eyes to see Jenny in the doorway. “Where have you b--” I started, turning on the lights, but my voice died in my throat. It wasn’t Jenny. It was Albert, hanging from the doorway of my room, swaying slightly back and forth above his shoes. The knife was back in his hand.

My heart was hammering. This was obviously just Jenny taking a joke too far, but when I called out for her again and she didn’t answer, my fear spiked. I took those clothes down, carried them downstairs and even though I knew it was totally illogical, I burned them in the fireplace.

I expected Jenny to come out to laugh at me once I got the fire going, or at least to chide me for stinking up the house -- I don’t know what they pack snow pants with, but it smells terrible when you burn it -- but the fire burned down to ashes and I was still alone.

I slept for a bit, and when I left for work this morning, there was still no sign of Jenny and she still wasn’t answering her phone. I called the police to report her missing, and they’re supposed to be sending someone over to take a look around and interview me, I guess.

I hope they get here soon. Because I just heard a noise from upstairs, and when I went up to look, the door to our walk-in closet was standing open. Hanging from the bars, aligned in two neat rows, were a dozen of Jenny’s outfits. Shirts on the hangers, pants clipped below, shoes lined up underneath.

The bedroom door only locks from the inside, but I closed it and used my tie to tie the knob to the banister in the hallway. I was going to leave the house, but there’s a coat rack by the door, and I really don’t think I lined my shoes up underneath it like that when I got home.

I hope the police get here soon.

                                            [selftext_html] => &lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had the strangest roommate in my freshman year of college. Despite being otherwise normal and even a bit shy, Eddy would, every so often, become frantically possessed by a sudden overwhelming need to lock the door. It didn&amp;#39;t matter which door, either. Wherever he was when the fit came upon him, he would leap up, run to the closest entrance, and lock it. People who stood in his way were screamed at. Anyone who tried to stop him would get attacked. He became a ranting sweaty madman until his mysterious sense of vulnerability passed—but the moment it was gone, he would apologize profusely, sink timidly into himself, and scurry away embarrassed. For that reason, it was hard to hate him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it became a little easier to despise him each time I returned home to find myself locked out. Similarly, each time I brought him to a party and he had one of his episodes, I inevitably lost potential romantic interests and friends because I was roommates with &lt;em&gt;that Eddy guy&lt;/em&gt;. Halfway through the year, after the third almost-girlfriend ghosted me because he scared the shit out of her, I put in for a dorm room transfer and washed my hands of the poor guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was almost seven years ago now, so when Eddy messaged me on social media and said he was in town and had run into some travel issues, I decided to give him another shot. I&amp;#39;d always felt sort of felt bad about how I&amp;#39;d treated him in the end. So, I drove half an hour out to his broken-down car and picked him up around one in the morning on a normal Wednesday night three weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember pulling up to the edge of a high cliff-side road to see a skinny silhouette waving at me. He was leaner than I remembered, and somewhat more in shape. My headlights illuminated him fully; I saw his face glisten, and I laughed. That was Eddy alright—sweat was sort of his hallmark. He hefted a duffel bag and ran up to my passenger side before fiddling with the door handle repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t pull it when I&amp;#39;m unlocking it,&amp;quot; I told him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He waited a tick; I pushed the button, and he tried the handle at the same time.  &amp;quot;Oops!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wait,&amp;quot; I said again, hitting unlock as I did so. &amp;quot;Ok, now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He finally got the door open and clambered in with a nervous laugh. &amp;quot;Sorry, man.&amp;quot; His long legs folded up a bit as he got situated, and I could see his exposed ankles. &amp;quot;Thanks for picking me up.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shrugged. &amp;quot;No problem at all. Do you know what&amp;#39;s wrong with it?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah, the alternator&amp;#39;s been having trouble. I think the cold weather finally did her in.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Cool.&amp;quot; I gave a slight cough to clear my throat, and we drove in awkward silence until he brought up a joke from the past. Just like that, we slipped into that first semester seven years before, with all its new experiences, hilarious misadventures, and surprise pressures. By the time we reached my place, I&amp;#39;d remembered the good things about him, and I was glad I&amp;#39;d decided to help him out. On the way in, I pointed to the couch. &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s probably the best spot in the apartment. I&amp;#39;m trying to save money these days, so the place is pretty small.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Rent these days, eh?&amp;quot; he asked, before placing his duffel bag down and sitting carefully on the couch to evaluate its softness. &amp;quot;This&amp;#39;ll do fine. I can&amp;#39;t thank you enough. I&amp;#39;ll get out of your hair in the morning as soon as the repair shops open.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No problem at all, Eddy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Actually, I go by Ed now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good for him. He&amp;#39;d definitely grown as a person from the socially fearful outcast I remembered. I grinned. &amp;quot;Then no problem at all, &lt;em&gt;Ed.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to bed back in my room without a single worry. It seemed like his issues had been resolved by maturity or medication, and who was I to judge someone for trouble beyond their control? That was in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I was completely wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around four in the morning, I awoke and got up to get a glass of water from the kitchen. I knew my own apartment, so my footsteps were pretty much silent, but Eddy still sighed and stirred on the couch as if something was bothering him. I stood by the fridge, glass in hand, as he whimpered, struggled, and then leapt up. In a mad terrified dash, he ran to my front door and slammed the deadbolt. He gave out a deep breath of relief and remained there with his head down while I tried to figure out the best way to let him know I was present. Well, if he was having a fit, there was no good way to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ed?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He seized up mightily, gasped in as much air as his lungs could hold, and then slowly turned around. His face was obscured in dimness, since the only light came from various red or green pinpoints on the television and microwave, but I could tell he was sweating profusely. After a long moment, he managed to breathe again. Finally, he said, &amp;quot;Oh. Hey. Didn&amp;#39;t see you there.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah.&amp;quot; I put my glass down on the counter. &amp;quot;You alright, dude?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He meant his laugh to sound nonchalant, but it just came out nervous and high-strung. &amp;quot;Same old, same old, you know how it is.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went around the counter and approached him. He moved back a few steps, and I touched the door. &amp;quot;This is a safe neighborhood. There&amp;#39;s nothing to worry about.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He nodded awkwardly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsure I believed his calmness, I moved my hand to the deadbolt. I wanted to make sure he wasn&amp;#39;t going to get weird while I was asleep if I went back to bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He made a sudden half-halted leap toward me, hand out. &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that moment, I was starting to remember the times I&amp;#39;d seen him attack people during an episode. &amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s nothing out there!&amp;quot; I gripped the deadbolt to turn it back toward me, but a very slight shadow moved somewhere in my vision. The hell? No, it couldn&amp;#39;t be. Reacting rapidly, I put my eye to the peephole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My brain made sense of the curved panorama just in time to see a sliver of a silhouette disappear along the sidewalk to the left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eddy moved closer, bringing the smell of his panicked sweat with him. &amp;quot;Did you see something?!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No,&amp;quot; I lied. I kept staring out through the peephole, watching the quiet night in my otherwise unremarkable neighborhood. The asphalt glimmered darkly under the stars while distant lamp posts cast long shadows across grass. &amp;quot;Remind me again, what makes you suddenly want to lock the door?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I wasn&amp;#39;t actively trying to unlock it, he seemed slightly less manic. &amp;quot;I never told you because I thought you were starting to hate me, but, uh, when I was eight years old I had a sudden feeling that I should lock the door. I didn&amp;#39;t, and, uh—&amp;quot; He shivered. &amp;quot;—some men broke in a moment later and robbed us.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I frowned at his glistening shadowed face. &amp;quot;Jesus. Was anyone hurt?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He nodded between audible breaths. &amp;quot;My mom.&amp;quot; Another three breaths passed in the otherwise silent darkness. &amp;quot;She didn&amp;#39;t make it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Damn.&amp;quot; I didn&amp;#39;t know what else to say. &amp;quot;Just—damn. No wonder.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No wonder?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I could elaborate, the sound of something skittering outside reached us. He turned and listened in one rapid motion like a startled animal, and I had to admit, I was none too calm either. Still, I couldn&amp;#39;t risk amping up his anxiety. I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; want to sleep again at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He whispered, &amp;quot;Where was that?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It sounded like it came from the back.&amp;quot; I whispered, too. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;s nothing. Let&amp;#39;s go.&amp;quot; I led the way, and we crept through my apartment. He made sure to mimic my steps, but he was still louder than me, and I nearly winced at every creak. By the time we entered my bedroom and reached a rear window, my nerves were raw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The window was fitted with stops that prevented it opening all the way; I usually left it open for the breeze, even in the winter. We sat in total darkness in front of that thin rectangle of cool air. Looking and listening, we sought any sign of what had made the noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever actually listened to the sounds of the city at night? What I&amp;#39;d gotten used to as silence was actually anything but. Soft wind stirred a rustling in the nearby bushes. A train blew a horn in the unknown distance. A dog barked twice. Briefly, an ambulance siren trekked across the horizon. Under it all, a constant low haunting wail emanated across the world from the nearby highway. I&amp;#39;d always hated that noise whenever I&amp;#39;d accidentally become aware of it because I thought it sounded like a thousand ghosts screaming from very far away, but I wasn&amp;#39;t about to tell Eddy that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was about that time that my gaze landed upon something among the trees. When I&amp;#39;d first seen the closely bunched collection of white pinpoints, I&amp;#39;d assumed they were reflections from somewhere. Now, though, as I watched them carefully, I was nearly certain I was seeing them &lt;em&gt;rotate&lt;/em&gt; upward. It was as if someone was spinning a wheel of lights whose narrow side was facing us; from the size and distance, the wheel must have been two or three feet in diameter. I whispered, &amp;quot;What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; that?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After finding it with help from my pointing finger, Eddy&amp;#39;s stare deepened. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve never seen anything like it. What could that possibly be?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t make sense of it. While I watched, it grew slightly dimmer, then slightly brighter. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s definitely casting light around it. I think I saw some leaves above it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is it changing?&amp;quot; Eddy clutched my wrist as he stared at those strange up-wheeling lights. &amp;quot;Is it getting bigger?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t be sure, but how could it be getting bigger unless—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jumping up, I placed my fingers on either side of the window and brought it down swiftly and quietly. Then, I turned the latch and locked it before pulling the nearby cord and sliding the blinds down. &amp;quot;Whatever it is, we&amp;#39;re secure in here. We&amp;#39;ll be fine. It&amp;#39;s probably just some kids playing with light toys or something.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He sighed and opened his mouth to speak, but a visible change came over the silhouetted contours of his head. An instant later, he leapt over and slammed my bedroom door shut. The boom echoed loudly in my ears. I demanded to know what he was doing as he locked my door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eddy turned around and put his back to it. I could tell he was wild-eyed from the way he whispered. &amp;quot;Be quiet! It&amp;#39;s in your apartment!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The adrenaline spike from the slammed door made me a little angrier than I wanted to be. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;What?&lt;/em&gt; What&amp;#39;s in my apartment?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His frantic whisper was nearly a hiss. &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;know!&lt;/em&gt; I just know that we have to keep this door locked!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was fuming, but if I spoke, I would have said something I regretted, so we stood there in the dark for a solid few minutes. I began to calm down as those minutes passed, and, once I was in control again, I opened my mouth to whisper. &amp;quot;Hey, I&amp;#39;m sorry, I—&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The floor creaked outside my bedroom door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I froze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eddy backed away from the door and faced it alongside me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was nothing but a dark rectangle in front of us, but I stared at it for &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; hint of motion or change. The crazy thing was, I had no idea what I was even looking or listening for. What could possibly have been out there? Not only had we left the front door locked, there&amp;#39;d been no sound of entry, forced or otherwise. If there &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; someone or something out there, how had they gotten in?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dim light began to move across the walls of my room, and I waited for the sound of a passing car—but none came. As we watched the door, brighter light began to roll upwards around us, again as if someone was spinning some sort of lit wheel. It didn&amp;#39;t take long for us to realize that whatever we&amp;#39;d seen in the distance outside was growing closer to my window. Beyond the blinds, something was coming nearer, but neither of us dared look away from my bedroom door for even an instant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I saw it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between moving lines of shadow and light, I could have sworn my door handle had changed angles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I backed away; a look at the blinds showed &lt;em&gt;definite&lt;/em&gt; lights spinning closer, as if they were right outside the window and about to come up against it. Grabbing Eddy by the shoulder, I pulled him with me into my tiny one-person bathroom. He closed and locked the door the instant we were inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My heart was hammering in my chest to the point of actual pain. Grunting my whisper, I asked, &amp;quot;What the &lt;em&gt;hell&lt;/em&gt; is happening?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He shook his head. &amp;quot;I have no idea.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Are you sure?&amp;quot; I asked him, squeezing his wrists. &amp;quot;This all started with that robbery and attack on your mom, right?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No,&amp;quot; he whispered back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My bathroom door was flush to the outside carpet, but hints of rotating light began to appear beneath, as if that insane impossible wheel had somehow entered my room without opening or breaking the window. None of this made sense! &amp;quot;It has to be you somehow.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It has to be!&amp;quot; I shook him violently. &amp;quot;Is your fear making it real? Is something after you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t understand,&amp;quot; he whimpered. &amp;quot;I didn&amp;#39;t finish the story. It didn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; with that incident. I&amp;#39;d been getting the urge to lock doors for years before that. The first time I didn&amp;#39;t—that&amp;#39;s when they came.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t understand exactly what he meant. &amp;quot;The robbers?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He shook his head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, god. &amp;quot;They weren&amp;#39;t robbers, were they?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He shook his head again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My voice dropped to a razor hiss. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;What&amp;#39;s out there, Eddy?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All he could say was, &amp;quot;They want in.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something about the way he said it finally made me understand. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s not about the bathroom door, is it?&amp;quot; I looked out through it, thinking of my bedroom door, and my apartment door beyond that. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s not about the literal entrance to the room you&amp;#39;re in.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rotating light below began intensifying as whatever was out there approached our hiding spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His panicked grip on my hands told me I was right. &amp;quot;Then why do you lock real doors, Eddy?&amp;quot; I shook him until he looked at me despite his fear. &amp;quot;Is it a metaphor? Does it make you feel better? Does it close them off somehow? &lt;em&gt;Why isn&amp;#39;t it working this time?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He began to cry, sending mixed drops of tears and sweat onto my forearms. &amp;quot;I couldn&amp;#39;t take it anymore. I&amp;#39;m tired of the constant struggle.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The high cliff-side curb where I&amp;#39;d picked him up flashed through my mind clear as crystal, and the fear that had been building since the moment I saw him wake suddenly left me. He&amp;#39;d gone to that cliff for a reason, and he&amp;#39;d probably had second thoughts as he stood there alone in the dark. Completely calm, I asked, &amp;quot;Your car didn&amp;#39;t break down, did it?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He shook his head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You messaged everyone, didn&amp;#39;t you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He nodded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And I was the only one that responded.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He rocked back and forth in front of me. &amp;quot;I just couldn&amp;#39;t take it anymore. They want in. They&amp;#39;re always out there. They want in. I always lock them out, but they never stop. I&amp;#39;m tired of being terrified every minute of every day!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air began moving under the door as the lights reached peak intensity outside; whatever it was, it was almost upon us. &amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s nowhere to go, Eddy. Let&amp;#39;s open that door. Maybe you&amp;#39;re constantly terrified because &lt;em&gt;they want you that way.&lt;/em&gt; Let&amp;#39;s face them. Let&amp;#39;s be unafraid—and it might just work.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He didn&amp;#39;t respond, but I dragged him to his feet. I had never wanted to do anything less in my entire life, but there was nowhere else to go. With a firm grip on his wrist, I reached forward with my free hand, unlocked the door, and flung it open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t care if you believe me. That&amp;#39;s not the point. But I&amp;#39;ll tell you what I saw: the lights were &lt;em&gt;eyes&lt;/em&gt;. They were bright enough to obscure the grotesque &lt;em&gt;moving&lt;/em&gt; body beneath. I still can&amp;#39;t understand how it was spinning like that. Snakelike curves connected things in shadow. Every blazing pinpoint swung up, flashed us with images of hatred and fear and paranoia, and then continued past, moving on too fast to process. That was the thing: the images were lies. My girlfriend was cheating on me. My teachers at school had thought of me as a failure. My boss hated me and only put up with me because he hadn&amp;#39;t found a replacement yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But each individual lie raced past too quickly to pick apart and resist. I knew they weren&amp;#39;t true, but they just kept coming. At the heart of this creature, I sensed a hunger for fear; I kicked a wide grasping mouth away and jerked Eddy out with me, getting a few feet past whatever the hell that thing was. It turned toward us again as I flung the bedroom door open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d been right about the door handle turning. That much I knew in that instant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The madly spinning shadows and light failed to illuminate the beast that lay beyond that door. Immediately, I knew the thing behind us was just a servant to &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;, because this was so, so, so, so much worse. The only thing I truly registered was a melted face. Its misshapen gaze seized the beating heart muscles in my chest and filled me with absolute terror, as if it had the power to reach inside me and dredge out all the blackness and animal fear in the corners of my human soul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew: these things didn&amp;#39;t want in to my apartment or my bedroom. It wasn&amp;#39;t so simple as that. They wanted in to &lt;em&gt;our world&lt;/em&gt;, and Eddy was some sort of conduit for that nightmarish goal. He always had been. I had the knife-keen vicious sense that I needed to kill him immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But maybe that urge came from the emotions those creatures were giving off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the sludge specter with the melted face began a rising scream that threatened to deafen me, I did what I had to do: I grabbed the heavy lamp from my nightstand and smashed my window clean through. I threw Eddy out a moment after, and then pulled my arm from a burning grip of caustic acid to escape. I could only lay on the ground screaming as Eddy did the rest by dragging me away from that place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was three weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The burn from the grasping hand of that sludge creature refused to heal. The doctors at the emergency room couldn&amp;#39;t make heads or tails of it. Something had burned the shape of a melted hand around my forearm—and continued to burn as they studied it. They could find no acid, no catalyst, and no heat. Eventually, they had to release me. Of course, their lack of understanding didn&amp;#39;t lessen the hefty medical bill any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I parted from Eddy the next day, telling him to stay strong and remain unafraid. We&amp;#39;d beaten the forces of hatred and paranoia personified and escaped with our lives by charging through rather than hiding. He seemed unconvinced, and repeatedly said that &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; hadn&amp;#39;t done anything, that &lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;d&lt;/em&gt; dragged him out of there, and that without me he didn&amp;#39;t know if he could do it. &amp;quot;But I have a life to live,&amp;quot; I told him. &amp;quot;Gotta pay off that ER bill and find a new place.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He understood—or at least, he said that he did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I saw Eddy again. He didn&amp;#39;t know I was there, because it was just a chance encounter on a city street. He was in a bar watching a television above and drinking a beer. I stood outside and watched him through the window for a moment, awed at the change. He was sitting with new friends. He was wry, confident, and completely ignoring the door of the bar instead of nervously looking at the entrances every so often. It was such a positive change that I actually went inside with a smile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I stopped about ten feet behind him as, over the noise of the bar television above, I began to hear what he was talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His words floated in the air with a nearly perceptible stench; sludge dripped from the back of his sentences, burning the ears of those near his group. His new friends agreed happily and haughtily, replying noxiously in kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A disgruntled customer nudged me as he passed. &amp;quot;Ignore those assholes.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I turned away with misting eyes and walked out into the chill night. I hadn&amp;#39;t saved Eddy at all. He&amp;#39;d found refuge not in standing up to those creatures, but by going down a path I hadn&amp;#39;t even considered. I looked through the window of that bar one last time. The misshapen creature that had burned me with its touch grinned back from the shadowed corners behind the television. It had found the entry into our world that it had craved for so long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d unlocked the door, but it was Eddy that had let them in. &lt;/p&gt;

                                            [selftext] => I had the strangest roommate in my freshman year of college. Despite being otherwise normal and even a bit shy, Eddy would, every so often, become frantically possessed by a sudden overwhelming need to lock the door. It didn't matter which door, either. Wherever he was when the fit came upon him, he would leap up, run to the closest entrance, and lock it. People who stood in his way were screamed at. Anyone who tried to stop him would get attacked. He became a ranting sweaty madman until his mysterious sense of vulnerability passed—but the moment it was gone, he would apologize profusely, sink timidly into himself, and scurry away embarrassed. For that reason, it was hard to hate him.

But it became a little easier to despise him each time I returned home to find myself locked out. Similarly, each time I brought him to a party and he had one of his episodes, I inevitably lost potential romantic interests and friends because I was roommates with *that Eddy guy*. Halfway through the year, after the third almost-girlfriend ghosted me because he scared the shit out of her, I put in for a dorm room transfer and washed my hands of the poor guy.

That was almost seven years ago now, so when Eddy messaged me on social media and said he was in town and had run into some travel issues, I decided to give him another shot. I'd always felt sort of felt bad about how I'd treated him in the end. So, I drove half an hour out to his broken-down car and picked him up around one in the morning on a normal Wednesday night three weeks ago.

I remember pulling up to the edge of a high cliff-side road to see a skinny silhouette waving at me. He was leaner than I remembered, and somewhat more in shape. My headlights illuminated him fully; I saw his face glisten, and I laughed. That was Eddy alright—sweat was sort of his hallmark. He hefted a duffel bag and ran up to my passenger side before fiddling with the door handle repeatedly.

"Don't pull it when I'm unlocking it," I told him.

He waited a tick; I pushed the button, and he tried the handle at the same time.  "Oops!"

"Wait," I said again, hitting unlock as I did so. "Ok, now."

He finally got the door open and clambered in with a nervous laugh. "Sorry, man." His long legs folded up a bit as he got situated, and I could see his exposed ankles. "Thanks for picking me up."


I shrugged. "No problem at all. Do you know what's wrong with it?"

"Yeah, the alternator's been having trouble. I think the cold weather finally did her in."

"Cool." I gave a slight cough to clear my throat, and we drove in awkward silence until he brought up a joke from the past. Just like that, we slipped into that first semester seven years before, with all its new experiences, hilarious misadventures, and surprise pressures. By the time we reached my place, I'd remembered the good things about him, and I was glad I'd decided to help him out. On the way in, I pointed to the couch. "That's probably the best spot in the apartment. I'm trying to save money these days, so the place is pretty small."

"Rent these days, eh?" he asked, before placing his duffel bag down and sitting carefully on the couch to evaluate its softness. "This'll do fine. I can't thank you enough. I'll get out of your hair in the morning as soon as the repair shops open."

"No problem at all, Eddy."

"Actually, I go by Ed now."

Good for him. He'd definitely grown as a person from the socially fearful outcast I remembered. I grinned. "Then no problem at all, *Ed.*"

I went to bed back in my room without a single worry. It seemed like his issues had been resolved by maturity or medication, and who was I to judge someone for trouble beyond their control? That was in the past.

Of course, I was completely wrong.

Around four in the morning, I awoke and got up to get a glass of water from the kitchen. I knew my own apartment, so my footsteps were pretty much silent, but Eddy still sighed and stirred on the couch as if something was bothering him. I stood by the fridge, glass in hand, as he whimpered, struggled, and then leapt up. In a mad terrified dash, he ran to my front door and slammed the deadbolt. He gave out a deep breath of relief and remained there with his head down while I tried to figure out the best way to let him know I was present. Well, if he was having a fit, there was no good way to do this.

"Ed?"

He seized up mightily, gasped in as much air as his lungs could hold, and then slowly turned around. His face was obscured in dimness, since the only light came from various red or green pinpoints on the television and microwave, but I could tell he was sweating profusely. After a long moment, he managed to breathe again. Finally, he said, "Oh. Hey. Didn't see you there."

"Yeah." I put my glass down on the counter. "You alright, dude?"

He meant his laugh to sound nonchalant, but it just came out nervous and high-strung. "Same old, same old, you know how it is."

I went around the counter and approached him. He moved back a few steps, and I touched the door. "This is a safe neighborhood. There's nothing to worry about."

He nodded awkwardly.

Unsure I believed his calmness, I moved my hand to the deadbolt. I wanted to make sure he wasn't going to get weird while I was asleep if I went back to bed.

He made a sudden half-halted leap toward me, hand out. "Don't!"

At that moment, I was starting to remember the times I'd seen him attack people during an episode. "There's nothing out there!" I gripped the deadbolt to turn it back toward me, but a very slight shadow moved somewhere in my vision. The hell? No, it couldn't be. Reacting rapidly, I put my eye to the peephole.

My brain made sense of the curved panorama just in time to see a sliver of a silhouette disappear along the sidewalk to the left.

Eddy moved closer, bringing the smell of his panicked sweat with him. "Did you see something?!"

"No," I lied. I kept staring out through the peephole, watching the quiet night in my otherwise unremarkable neighborhood. The asphalt glimmered darkly under the stars while distant lamp posts cast long shadows across grass. "Remind me again, what makes you suddenly want to lock the door?"

Now that I wasn't actively trying to unlock it, he seemed slightly less manic. "I never told you because I thought you were starting to hate me, but, uh, when I was eight years old I had a sudden feeling that I should lock the door. I didn't, and, uh—" He shivered. "—some men broke in a moment later and robbed us."

I frowned at his glistening shadowed face. "Jesus. Was anyone hurt?"

He nodded between audible breaths. "My mom." Another three breaths passed in the otherwise silent darkness. "She didn't make it."

"Damn." I didn't know what else to say. "Just—damn. No wonder."

"No wonder?"

Before I could elaborate, the sound of something skittering outside reached us. He turned and listened in one rapid motion like a startled animal, and I had to admit, I was none too calm either. Still, I couldn't risk amping up his anxiety. I *did* want to sleep again at some point.

He whispered, "Where was that?"

"It sounded like it came from the back." I whispered, too. "I'm sure it's nothing. Let's go." I led the way, and we crept through my apartment. He made sure to mimic my steps, but he was still louder than me, and I nearly winced at every creak. By the time we entered my bedroom and reached a rear window, my nerves were raw.

The window was fitted with stops that prevented it opening all the way; I usually left it open for the breeze, even in the winter. We sat in total darkness in front of that thin rectangle of cool air. Looking and listening, we sought any sign of what had made the noise.

Have you ever actually listened to the sounds of the city at night? What I'd gotten used to as silence was actually anything but. Soft wind stirred a rustling in the nearby bushes. A train blew a horn in the unknown distance. A dog barked twice. Briefly, an ambulance siren trekked across the horizon. Under it all, a constant low haunting wail emanated across the world from the nearby highway. I'd always hated that noise whenever I'd accidentally become aware of it because I thought it sounded like a thousand ghosts screaming from very far away, but I wasn't about to tell Eddy that. 

It was about that time that my gaze landed upon something among the trees. When I'd first seen the closely bunched collection of white pinpoints, I'd assumed they were reflections from somewhere. Now, though, as I watched them carefully, I was nearly certain I was seeing them *rotate* upward. It was as if someone was spinning a wheel of lights whose narrow side was facing us; from the size and distance, the wheel must have been two or three feet in diameter. I whispered, "What *is* that?"

After finding it with help from my pointing finger, Eddy's stare deepened. "I've never seen anything like it. What could that possibly be?"

I couldn't make sense of it. While I watched, it grew slightly dimmer, then slightly brighter. "It's definitely casting light around it. I think I saw some leaves above it."

"Is it changing?" Eddy clutched my wrist as he stared at those strange up-wheeling lights. "Is it getting bigger?"

I couldn't be sure, but how could it be getting bigger unless—

Jumping up, I placed my fingers on either side of the window and brought it down swiftly and quietly. Then, I turned the latch and locked it before pulling the nearby cord and sliding the blinds down. "Whatever it is, we're secure in here. We'll be fine. It's probably just some kids playing with light toys or something."

He sighed and opened his mouth to speak, but a visible change came over the silhouetted contours of his head. An instant later, he leapt over and slammed my bedroom door shut. The boom echoed loudly in my ears. I demanded to know what he was doing as he locked my door.

Eddy turned around and put his back to it. I could tell he was wild-eyed from the way he whispered. "Be quiet! It's in your apartment!"

The adrenaline spike from the slammed door made me a little angrier than I wanted to be. "*What?* What's in my apartment?"

His frantic whisper was nearly a hiss. "I don't *know!* I just know that we have to keep this door locked!"

I was fuming, but if I spoke, I would have said something I regretted, so we stood there in the dark for a solid few minutes. I began to calm down as those minutes passed, and, once I was in control again, I opened my mouth to whisper. "Hey, I'm sorry, I—"

The floor creaked outside my bedroom door.

I froze.

Eddy backed away from the door and faced it alongside me.

It was nothing but a dark rectangle in front of us, but I stared at it for *any* hint of motion or change. The crazy thing was, I had no idea what I was even looking or listening for. What could possibly have been out there? Not only had we left the front door locked, there'd been no sound of entry, forced or otherwise. If there *was* someone or something out there, how had they gotten in?

Dim light began to move across the walls of my room, and I waited for the sound of a passing car—but none came. As we watched the door, brighter light began to roll upwards around us, again as if someone was spinning some sort of lit wheel. It didn't take long for us to realize that whatever we'd seen in the distance outside was growing closer to my window. Beyond the blinds, something was coming nearer, but neither of us dared look away from my bedroom door for even an instant.

Then, I saw it.

Between moving lines of shadow and light, I could have sworn my door handle had changed angles.

I backed away; a look at the blinds showed *definite* lights spinning closer, as if they were right outside the window and about to come up against it. Grabbing Eddy by the shoulder, I pulled him with me into my tiny one-person bathroom. He closed and locked the door the instant we were inside.

My heart was hammering in my chest to the point of actual pain. Grunting my whisper, I asked, "What the *hell* is happening?"

He shook his head. "I have no idea."

"Are you sure?" I asked him, squeezing his wrists. "This all started with that robbery and attack on your mom, right?"

"No," he whispered back.

My bathroom door was flush to the outside carpet, but hints of rotating light began to appear beneath, as if that insane impossible wheel had somehow entered my room without opening or breaking the window. None of this made sense! "It has to be you somehow."

"No!"

"It has to be!" I shook him violently. "Is your fear making it real? Is something after you?"

"You don't understand," he whimpered. "I didn't finish the story. It didn't *start* with that incident. I'd been getting the urge to lock doors for years before that. The first time I didn't—that's when they came."

I couldn't understand exactly what he meant. "The robbers?"

He shook his head.

Oh, god. "They weren't robbers, were they?"

He shook his head again.

My voice dropped to a razor hiss. "*What's out there, Eddy?*"

All he could say was, "They want in."

Something about the way he said it finally made me understand. "It's not about the bathroom door, is it?" I looked out through it, thinking of my bedroom door, and my apartment door beyond that. "It's not about the literal entrance to the room you're in."

The rotating light below began intensifying as whatever was out there approached our hiding spot.

His panicked grip on my hands told me I was right. "Then why do you lock real doors, Eddy?" I shook him until he looked at me despite his fear. "Is it a metaphor? Does it make you feel better? Does it close them off somehow? *Why isn't it working this time?*"

He began to cry, sending mixed drops of tears and sweat onto my forearms. "I couldn't take it anymore. I'm tired of the constant struggle."

The high cliff-side curb where I'd picked him up flashed through my mind clear as crystal, and the fear that had been building since the moment I saw him wake suddenly left me. He'd gone to that cliff for a reason, and he'd probably had second thoughts as he stood there alone in the dark. Completely calm, I asked, "Your car didn't break down, did it?"

He shook his head.

"You messaged everyone, didn't you?"

He nodded.

"And I was the only one that responded."

He rocked back and forth in front of me. "I just couldn't take it anymore. They want in. They're always out there. They want in. I always lock them out, but they never stop. I'm tired of being terrified every minute of every day!"

Air began moving under the door as the lights reached peak intensity outside; whatever it was, it was almost upon us. "There's nowhere to go, Eddy. Let's open that door. Maybe you're constantly terrified because *they want you that way.* Let's face them. Let's be unafraid—and it might just work."

He didn't respond, but I dragged him to his feet. I had never wanted to do anything less in my entire life, but there was nowhere else to go. With a firm grip on his wrist, I reached forward with my free hand, unlocked the door, and flung it open.

I don't care if you believe me. That's not the point. But I'll tell you what I saw: the lights were *eyes*. They were bright enough to obscure the grotesque *moving* body beneath. I still can't understand how it was spinning like that. Snakelike curves connected things in shadow. Every blazing pinpoint swung up, flashed us with images of hatred and fear and paranoia, and then continued past, moving on too fast to process. That was the thing: the images were lies. My girlfriend was cheating on me. My teachers at school had thought of me as a failure. My boss hated me and only put up with me because he hadn't found a replacement yet.

But each individual lie raced past too quickly to pick apart and resist. I knew they weren't true, but they just kept coming. At the heart of this creature, I sensed a hunger for fear; I kicked a wide grasping mouth away and jerked Eddy out with me, getting a few feet past whatever the hell that thing was. It turned toward us again as I flung the bedroom door open.

I'd been right about the door handle turning. That much I knew in that instant.

The madly spinning shadows and light failed to illuminate the beast that lay beyond that door. Immediately, I knew the thing behind us was just a servant to *this*, because this was so, so, so, so much worse. The only thing I truly registered was a melted face. Its misshapen gaze seized the beating heart muscles in my chest and filled me with absolute terror, as if it had the power to reach inside me and dredge out all the blackness and animal fear in the corners of my human soul.

I knew: these things didn't want in to my apartment or my bedroom. It wasn't so simple as that. They wanted in to *our world*, and Eddy was some sort of conduit for that nightmarish goal. He always had been. I had the knife-keen vicious sense that I needed to kill him immediately.

But maybe that urge came from the emotions those creatures were giving off.

As the sludge specter with the melted face began a rising scream that threatened to deafen me, I did what I had to do: I grabbed the heavy lamp from my nightstand and smashed my window clean through. I threw Eddy out a moment after, and then pulled my arm from a burning grip of caustic acid to escape. I could only lay on the ground screaming as Eddy did the rest by dragging me away from that place.

That was three weeks ago.

The burn from the grasping hand of that sludge creature refused to heal. The doctors at the emergency room couldn't make heads or tails of it. Something had burned the shape of a melted hand around my forearm—and continued to burn as they studied it. They could find no acid, no catalyst, and no heat. Eventually, they had to release me. Of course, their lack of understanding didn't lessen the hefty medical bill any.

I parted from Eddy the next day, telling him to stay strong and remain unafraid. We'd beaten the forces of hatred and paranoia personified and escaped with our lives by charging through rather than hiding. He seemed unconvinced, and repeatedly said that *we* hadn't done anything, that *I'd* dragged him out of there, and that without me he didn't know if he could do it. "But I have a life to live," I told him. "Gotta pay off that ER bill and find a new place."

He understood—or at least, he said that he did.

Today, I saw Eddy again. He didn't know I was there, because it was just a chance encounter on a city street. He was in a bar watching a television above and drinking a beer. I stood outside and watched him through the window for a moment, awed at the change. He was sitting with new friends. He was wry, confident, and completely ignoring the door of the bar instead of nervously looking at the entrances every so often. It was such a positive change that I actually went inside with a smile.

But I stopped about ten feet behind him as, over the noise of the bar television above, I began to hear what he was talking about.

His words floated in the air with a nearly perceptible stench; sludge dripped from the back of his sentences, burning the ears of those near his group. His new friends agreed happily and haughtily, replying noxiously in kind.

A disgruntled customer nudged me as he passed. "Ignore those assholes."

I turned away with misting eyes and walked out into the chill night. I hadn't saved Eddy at all. He'd found refuge not in standing up to those creatures, but by going down a path I hadn't even considered. I looked through the window of that bar one last time. The misshapen creature that had burned me with its touch grinned back from the shadowed corners behind the television. It had found the entry into our world that it had craved for so long.

I'd unlocked the door, but it was Eddy that had let them in.

&lt;p&gt;My mommy died. The lady I go to talk to told me to write to you, and tell you what I think of mommy dying. I think it’s a dumb idea, and the lady is dumb, and you’re dumb, and daddy is dumb. Granny makes me go to see the lady but it’s stupid. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My daddy doesn’t want to talk about what happened. He just says mommy got called home to heaven. But he’s stupid and wrong. Heaven doesn’t exist for mommy, or me, or you. Nobody will listen when I tell them about the Shadow Man. He’s what killed mommy! But no, they just say mommy was ready to go be with the angels but angels don’t exist. I think that whole idea of angels and demons is just so adults don’t get scared. So when I tell them about the Shadow Man and they tell me to stop, I don’t get mad. I know it’s just because they’re scared. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was scared, before. When I first saw the Shadow Man. But he was with mommy for ages. Since I was little and mommy would carry me home from school when I was tired. I miss mommy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When daddy started hitting mommy, the Shadow Man started to come to visit more and more. First he was little, like Piglet. Then he became big like me, then big like mommy and then even bigger, like daddy. But he never hurt mommy, he just kind of sat on her back. Like a giant backpack. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew he hurt mommy, but she didn’t seem to mind him. Sometimes, when I went to see her in the morning, I would see her cuddling the Shadow Man and not daddy. I know she loved the Shadow Man more than she loved daddy. I think she loved the Shadow Man more than me, too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realised what mommy was going to do when she was cleaning dishes one day, and the Shadow Man jumped on her back. She just fell to the ground, and started crying. I didn’t know what to do so I just watched. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When mommy took me on a drive, the Shadow Man was massive. He filled up the whole car and was so big I couldn’t see very well but I heard it. I heard it I heard it I heard it I heard it I heard it I heard it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone else heard it too, but the Shadow Man let them see because they started screaming. When they saw me they started screaming even louder. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, the Shadow Man went. And daddy stopped calling me his sweetie and started glaring at me. He stopped taking me to Scouts and started drinking lots of the bottles mommy used to drink. He started putting me to bed too, like mommy used to, but he didn’t leave always. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we went to mommy’s funeral, I saw the Shadow Man again. I thought he was there to say goodbye to mommy at first but he was little again, like Piglet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then he jumped onto my head. &lt;/p&gt;

All the long halls, the big doors, the cathedral ceilings. What was once an empty lot is now filled with joy and laughter, young couples starting their lives and having kids, older couples enjoying their later years together. As for me, I was so excited to move to the city and start a new life, and totally forget the old me. New city, new me. Since it was only built six months ago, I was the very first to reside there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the dogs in the apartments, who bark all night, but I don’t mind! I don’t really need sleep anyway and I don’t have a job. Plus, when they bark, which they always do when they see me, I don’t feel lonely. There are so many people to meet and hang out with! I do miss my mom sometimes, not so much my dad. He was rotten. Anyway! My building! The kids are so playful and nice. I love hearing their laughter. It’s so loud I can hear it where I reside. There was no laughter in the house I grew up in. All we did was chores, and if we didn’t do chores, there would be consequences. That’s why I thought living by myself would be so great, even if my dad tried to force me to stay. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a family in apartment 24 that I don’t like the dad much. They moved into the building last month. It really reminded me of my life back home, which I try to forget in my new life. The mom cooks, cleans, and works full time, with three kids at home. Two girls and a boy to be exact. When the mother leaves, the father is mean to his kids. He hits them, I can hear the all-too-familiar sound. I could hear the kids crying, too, and I don’t like when I can hear them cry. I decided that I wanted to scare the dad just a little bit, so I knocked on the door, but when he opened it, I was gone. Classic ding-dong-ditch, I know. But I never got to do those types of things as a kid because it was rules rules rules, so it’s fun I can do it now. Sometimes, when I can hear the children crying and I know he’s left his front door unlocked, I open it slowly, then slam it real hard! When he goes outside to look who did it, I’m gone. Boom. Vanish. I can be tricky like that. It normally gets him to stop hurting the kids, and they stop crying. Temporary relief. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember when I told my mom I was leaving. I was finally eighteen, and I could move to the city and play by my own rules and didn’t have to deal with home-life any longer. She was sad, but she understood. Like I said, new city new me! But when my dad caught wind I was leaving, he wasn’t having it. He knocked me so hard in the head, I never thought I was going to get up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I did get up. Next thing I know, I’m in an empty lot in the city. The last thing my dad said to me was, “Well, you finally made it to the city. Bitch,” before he left me there. At that time, there wasn’t much around. People passing by didn’t even acknowledge I was there. No doors to slam, no walls to walk through, no children laughing. That’s why I love my new apartment building. No one knows I’m here but I’m never lonely. I mean, I love the new me, I just wish that when they were putting the building in, they dug deep enough to find the old me.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m always looking around online for new places to explore, though I thought I had already visited just about everywhere within a few hours drive of my city.  Last week I was on an Urban Exploration forum looking for recommendations for locations near my area.  I clicked through several pages, finally coming to one from 2005.  There was a single post that mentioned something about an entire abandoned mining town named Perennial somewhere in the mountains southwest of my city.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I opened up Google maps and spent the better part of an hour searching the area, finally finding a criss-crossing grid of roads that clearly used to be a town.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This grabbed my attention.  An entire town abandoned?  It sounded like a gold mine for exploration.  I looked around the web, but only found one other mention of it anywhere.  It was on some .gov website listing historic mining towns high up in the mountains.  The website said that the town had been founded in the early 1900’s, and that it had been all but abandoned for more than 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a number to call at the bottom page, so I dialed it.  The voice that answered was old and gravelly.  He introduced himself as the sheriff in charge of the county.     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked him about the town, and he immediately grew angry.  He told me that the town had closed decades back due to severe heavy metal poisoning in the water supply, and that it was incredibly dangerous to go anywhere near there.  When I pressed for more info, he told me to drop the issue and hung up on me.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can imagine, this only fueled my desire to visit the town.  I called up my friend Jen, a fellow explorer, and the two of us set out one night to document the place.  I brought along my DSLR cameras, a powerful LED light, and Jen brought her own camera with some supplies.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drive took us deep up into the mountains.  Soon my GPS told me to turn off on a gravel road which we drove on for what must’ve been an hour.  I recorded some of the footage here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0O9LoeBHJU8"&gt;Link to the drive up on the highway.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon the gravel road turned to dirt.  We were concerned about that, but the dirt was pretty dry and hard-packed, so I figured my car could handle it.  On top of that, we’d already driven something like 2 hours.  Turning back empty-handed just wasn’t on the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X95X0pvQH4"&gt;Here is the footage of us driving on the dirt road.  You’ll have to forgive the shaky camera, the road was very rough.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ground was getting rougher and rougher, so we left my car by the side of the road and continued on foot.  We walked for another 10 minutes or so.  To the right of the path I saw several open mineshafts.  We saw a couple roads that were sealed off with signs like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/Jg7OYVS.jpg"&gt;Picture of the “Keep Out” sign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn’t want to fall down an open mine somewhere, so we kept away from those areas.  The night wasn’t too cold, but it was incredibly windy.  We kept moving forward and came upon an area with oversized mining supplies left out in the open air to rust.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbLd6j_p1RU"&gt;Here is the footage I took of that equipment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had just stopped recording that bit of footage, when I heard it.  This sound, carried on the wind.  The best way I can describe it would be to say it sounded like a man moaning out in his sleep.  Incoherent, distressed, distorted from the wind, and coming from what sounded like a mile away.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jen looked at me.  “You hearing this?” She asked.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The yelling stopped as instantly as it started.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Are we sure this town is as abandoned as we think?”  I asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to be honest, the sound shook me pretty bad, but Jen convinced me that it was probably just the wind rushing through a building in the distance somewhere.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We walked along the roads, stopping every once in a while to take pictures of unrecognizable wooden structures that might’ve been railroads or bridges when they were still in use.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EXclnPQyZw"&gt;Footage of the structures we saw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was using the LED light on top of my camera to light our way so we didn’t trip over anything.  We crested a hill and I caught sight of something red near the bottom.  I walked closer; it was the top half of a mountain lion’s body.  I realized it wasn’t even half, just its head and and front leg remained, the bottom of its body was missing, and had been cut off in a straight line.  The cut was so clean it looked like somebody had stuck it into a guillotine.  A line of blood trailed from the body, ending a few feet away.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jen knelt down next to it.  “Crazy how vicious animals can be huh?” She said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What are you talking about?” I said.  “You think an animal did this?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jen shrugged.  “What else could it be?  Probably just some bear that wanted its meal back at home.  We’re in the mountains after all.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t think that an animal could make a cut like that.  That being said, I’m far from an outdoorsman so I took Jen at her word.  We set off again, deeper into town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon a brick building came into view.  I took a quick picture.  Sorry for the blurriness, my hands were shaking a little bit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/gQMiNPW.jpg"&gt;Shot of the building&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked around the outside of it, marveling.  It was an urban explorer’s dream, everything I had hoped to find in this town.  I couldn’t tear my eyes off it, and ended up tripping, falling onto my face.  My camera skittered out of my hands, and tumbled several times in the dirt.  I ran after it, and snatched it up.  It was completely covered in a dusting of dirt, but thankfully looked like it was still working.  I tried rubbing the dirt off with limited success.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Let’s go inside.”  Jen said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told her to go ahead, and that I was going to finish cleaning off my camera.  She shrugged, and jumped through a broken window by the door.  I took a picture to see if I had cleaned it off enough, and the flash lit up the front of the building.  Then I heard it again, the moaning yell from before coming from the inside of the building.  Then I heard Jen’s shriek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/KN8x5r4.jpg"&gt;Here is the picture I took&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked up my courage for a moment, then jumped into the window after her.  I ran into every room and hall in the building, and shouted out her name.  I didn’t a sign of her until the very last room.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last room had a wooden door half open.  I found her camera laying inside on the floor with its strap broken.  I flipped through her memory card, and saw the last video taken on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvkI9OFyoJ0"&gt;Here is that video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I searched through every room in the building for half an hour, yelling, screaming, and finding nothing.  I didn’t know what to do.  I didn’t have service on my phone, it was a half hour walk to the car, and there was no sign of where she’d gone.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked all the way around the building, but didn’t see any tracks leading to or away from it, other than our own initial ones.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to run back to my car. I drove along the dirt road until I had service.  I pulled out my phone to call 911, but found myself calling the sheriff from the website earlier.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He sounded groggy as he answered the phone.  I told him what happened as fast as I could, and sat there hyperventilating waiting for his answer.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You morons have no idea what you got yourselves into,” He said.  “Drive to my office tomorrow morning and we’ll talk.  There’s nothing you can do for her at this point.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been outside his office typing this up for the past few hours, waiting for sunrise.  I’ve also been looking through the pictures I took for clues, and I think I might have found something in the second picture of the building.  There might be something standing inside the window by the door, but I’m not sure.  I’ll update you after I talk with the ranger.  If he doesn’t have anything helpful to say, I’ll go back by myself and search until I find her.  &lt;/p&gt;

Death of a relative being another. My mother had died, our Father, years before that, leaving me the appointed guardian of William, my 7-year-old brother. It seemed like in our case, these two sources of stress ended up hand in hand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked a shitty job, and being a 7-year-old, Will had trouble coming by much heavy income, so we found ourselves struggling to afford to stay in the same house any longer. Despite all of the memories attached to the house, I knew we couldn’t stay there forever. The thought of our mother singing in the kitchen as we ate our breakfast, or dad sitting peacefully in his study, building that model boat he always hoped to finish. Living there, knowing these memories never stood the chance of being recreated, was too much to handle. We had to move far from there, and so we did our best to settle down elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new house was larger than I had expected for the price. Long, thick wooden planks lined the outer walls, layers of sliced wood worn by the decades of sun and weather. Dark shingles lay on the roof, contrasting the light blue sky above them. It wasn’t as homely as we were used to, but it was worlds better than having nothing. A thick forest tree-line surrounded the back of the property, seemingly fading into darkness as it stretched into the distance, heavy foliage blanketing the ground from the sun’s full power. Long, thick grass preceded it, reaching above knee height, separating the forest from the clearing. The area gave off a sense of tranquility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After roughly a week of having moved into the house, I was watching my brother from inside the house as he ran in circles, chasing after our old dog, Lucy. A beautiful golden labrador, Will especially loved her to bits. Over and over again they raced each other in the spacious grass clearing. They were happy, and I was glad to see that he was still able to have fun despite what we’d been through. Maybe he just didn’t understand everything that was going on around him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found myself lost in my own thoughts, daydreaming through the window when I was taken by surprise as I heard a cry for my name. The voice was unmistakable - my brother. I ran to him, regretting becoming so distracted in such an unfamiliar place. He was crying, blood running from his toe as he held it in his hands. He’d stubbed it on something that had been lying in the long grass at the edge of the property. I carried him back to the house to nurse his wound, my clean shirt stained by the mixture of blood and dirt. I paid it no mind, what mattered was making sure that he was fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It came to my attention that the dog was nowhere to be found. I called for her, yelling her name several times from the porch, but she never showed up. I made my way towards the bushes, the dark expanse of the tree-line forming a wall of shadows receding for miles in the distance. I found myself at the place where my brother had hurt himself, calling for the dog still. As I walked through the long grass, I kicked something on the ground. A root sticking out of the dirt, which I assumed to be the culprit which had caused Will’s injury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t find the dog that night. Will cried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It got dark surprisingly quickly, the eerie backdrop of the woods growing tenfold in its shadows, even darker than I assumed to be possible. I sat on the porch, rocking on an old chair that looked like it had sat there for a millennium before I’d even been born, in hopes that maybe the dog would return, I didn’t want to lose her, but it had become too dark to search for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no idea when it started, but I noticed a faint yellow glow creep its way through the darkness, slowly moving from one side to another, as if someone were to be holding a light in heavy fog. It approached the house, the intensity seeming to pulsate, growing and fading as if it was following some unheard rhythm. Then, it stopped, roughly at the same place that Will had been injured. It just glowed, unbothered and unwavering. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A whistling noise caught my attention, sifting quietly through the air, barely audible but just able to be picked up by the ear. It droned through the breeze, muted, slightly wobbling in pitch. It was eerie, the tones altering in notes and octaves, mesmerising me with the sound of it all. I felt the hairs on my neck raise, and then, just like a cold wave, the feeling that I was being watched overcame my senses. The light flickered for a second as the whistling turned sharper, gradually getting louder, as if building up to a crescendo that felt as if it would never come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My eardrums felt as if they were about to burst due to the pressure that seemed to rise in the previously calm atmosphere. I placed my hands to each side of my head, trying to block the noise out to the best of my abilities. I tried to urge my feet to get up and let me crawl back into the house, hoping I’d find a safe haven between those walls, but it felt as if my bones were filled with lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, now, too deep in fear, I remained still in my seat. My eyes were wide open, bulging in their sockets - all I wanted was to run and make sure my brother was okay, but I couldn’t move one inch. Beads of sweat trickled down my forehead - there was an itch inside my head that I couldn’t reach, as if someone was tickling the very centre of my brain. I gritted my teeth, unable to make even the slightest sound escape my mouth. I couldn’t beg for it to stop. I was completely and utterly powerless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, as soon as it appeared, it was all gone. As if the disastrous climax had been reached, the noise, the feeling of being watched, the light, all disappeared within a blink. I sat there, stunned, scanning the trees in my sight. There was nothing but blackness between them. A hollow void. For what felt like hours, I sat unmoving in my seat, gazing alert at the wall of trunks ahead of me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, I barely slept that night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning I was awoken by a loud knock on the front door, jolting me awake, Somehow, during the night, I’d wandered inside and crashed on the couch. My bones felt stiff and disjointed as I recovered from my sleepy state. Heavy thumping echoed through the house. Whoever stood beyond that door refused to be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A man was at the door, his burly chest heaving with every breath he took. He was undoubtedly very angry, his tiny, sunken eyes alight with a certain kind of annoyance. I looked at him, puzzled, as he yelled at me about the little sleep he and his wife caught the night before due to ‘some aggravating mutt’ barking its lungs out through the late and early hours. He only got angrier when I told him I hadn’t seen the dog since yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After he stormed off with a dissatisfied grunt, I marched outside, pushing the door open heavily, out into the open yard behind the house. Heading towards the area, I felt a strong determination to find out what exactly I had seen and heard. Reaching the spot where I’d seen the light, I stopped dead in my tracks, a feeling of nausea hitting me like a wave. Laying limp, dark red liquid strewn for metres around her, was my beloved dog. Savagely hacked, gashes and wounds deeply cut into the now matted, dirty fur, it was a site of pure horror. Propping myself up by a tree I felt my stomach threaten to escape my body entirely, the shock taking me heavily. I didn’t know what to think, what to say, what to do. There were chunks missing from the dog’s body, seemingly torn off at random by whatever it was that did this to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will didn’t understand why I was digging a hole in the yard all of a sudden. I didn’t think I could tell him the truth. He’d lost enough so far. We both had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next few nights were empty. No lights, no noise, no dead animals, no angry neighbours. I found myself on edge at first, staring deeply at the trees, fearing that the light would appear again. Praying it wouldn’t. I could still recall that piercing sound, seeping into my skull and overpowering me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, nothing else happened for about a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sitting in front of the television late at night, a familiar yellow glow reflected on the screen, the mirror image of what came through the window outside. I jumped out of my seat, rushing to the sill, my breath catching in my lungs. Just as it happened the first time, the light made its way through the trees, shining like a beacon on a stormy sea. The air was dead, no sound, as if the rest of the world had just hushed expectantly. It stopped. It stayed unwavering for what felt like hours, but in reality I’m sure could’ve been seconds. Until all of a sudden it started moving towards the house. Although its pace was the same, with every passing moment I could feel the fear twist my guts into knots. Gradually growing in size, the blob of light approached the house through the trees, stopping dead at the weeds before it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I backed away. I just hid from it, going back to the state of a fearful child. I wanted nothing to do with it. With my hands clamped tight over my ears, and crouched low on the floor, I waited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I awoke on the floor the next morning, in the same place where I had hidden the night before. I uncurled myself, peeling my heavy body off of the floor slowly and feeling relieved at the sunlight floating in through the window. The morning felt good. It felt safe. I ate my toast with eggs, the side of bacon a nice treat that got my mind off last night’s events. I considered going to wake Will up, but then decided to let him sleep in. It was the weekend, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly I was pulled out of my pleasant morning daze by a loud pounding on the front door. Shuffling to the entryway, the man’s burly chest assaulted my eyes as he squinted at me in rage from the decking. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was here to complain about the poor sleep he’d had the night before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blood drained from my face. He yelled more. My ears rang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He told me I need to keep control of the child that had been yelling through the late and early hours. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days later, I moved again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;

Praying it wouldn’t. I could still recall that piercing sound, seeping into my skull and overpowering me. 

Yet, nothing else happened for about a month.
 
Sitting in front of the television late at night, a familiar yellow glow reflected on the screen, the mirror image of what came through the window outside. I jumped out of my seat, rushing to the sill, my breath catching in my lungs. Just as it happened the first time, the light made its way through the trees, shining like a beacon on a stormy sea. The air was dead, no sound, as if the rest of the world had just hushed expectantly. It stopped. It stayed unwavering for what felt like hours, but in reality I’m sure could’ve been seconds. Until all of a sudden it started moving towards the house. Although its pace was the same, with every passing moment I could feel the fear twist my guts into knots. Gradually growing in size, the blob of light approached the house through the trees, stopping dead at the weeds before it.
 
I backed away. I just hid from it, going back to the state of a fearful child. I wanted nothing to do with it. With my hands clamped tight over my ears, and crouched low on the floor, I waited.
 

 
I awoke on the floor the next morning, in the same place where I had hidden the night before. I uncurled myself, peeling my heavy body off of the floor slowly and feeling relieved at the sunlight floating in through the window. The morning felt good. It felt safe. I ate my toast with eggs, the side of bacon a nice treat that got my mind off last night’s events. I considered going to wake Will up, but then decided to let him sleep in. It was the weekend, after all.
 
Suddenly I was pulled out of my pleasant morning daze by a loud pounding on the front door. Shuffling to the entryway, the man’s burly chest assaulted my eyes as he squinted at me in rage from the decking. 
 
He was here to complain about the poor sleep he’d had the night before. 

The blood drained from my face. He yelled more. My ears rang.

He told me I need to keep control of the child that had been yelling through the late and early hours. 

A few days later, I moved again. 

Alone.

Grabbing the rocky soil, there was at least 4 inches of snow when we entered the cave.  Looking around trying to make sense of what I am seeing.  The trees looked the same, just a touch of purple hew but the sky…it was all wrong.  It was purple, like the twilight of the day, but the sun was in the peak of the sky.  There were no clouds in sight, no wind, and the air felt thick.  That thick feeling of humidity before a summer storm but no clouds for miles.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to gather my thoughts I look around for a way to get off the ledge I am on.  You see the tunnel came out on an outcropping with no way down but a 15 ft drop to the floor.  I sit on the ledge and look out into the distance, there are no birds no sounds of the wild.  I mean not a sound….what I would imagine space sounds like.  This scares me even more than the color of the sky.  I&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is in that stillness I hear it, a voice calling out.  Faint at first but becoming clearer by the second.  It was my daughter.  “Dad where are you?” she said with a cracking voice.  “Over here” I yelled looking into the tree line.  I see her coming through the woods, breaking twigs as she approaches.  “How did you get down there?”, I call out.  No response for a few moments, as I hear her approaching closer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The steps stop, “Dad come down now we gotta go!”, she yells from the tree line.  “Honey I cannot get down from here, go back to the cave entrance I will meet you there.”, I call out.  I peer into the trees seeing her silhouette standing motionless. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No we gotta go now! Come down dad”, I hear frustration in her voice.  “Just jump off, we gotta go.”, she says.  Alarm bells are ringing in my head, how the fuck did she find me, when I don’t know where I am?  “I will meet you at the cave!” I yell again.  There is a long pause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Get down NOW!!”, she screams but this time the voice was garbled.  Like a old tape being fast forward.  This brought me to my feet, “who are you?” I say.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just then I hear my daughter or what sounds like my daughter giggle, and then steps out of the tree line.  It was a fuzzy man, or silhouette or something.  But it had no defined form, no face nothing.  I could feel it staring at me as it walked out of the trees.  It still called to me in my daughter’s voice, “daddy come down”.  I stumble backwards as the thing starts into a sprint.  I hear it coming up the rock face, I dive and crawl back into the tunnel scrapping up my knees and elbows as I go.  About 10 ft in I come to a fork, “what the fuck?  This was not here before.”  Before I can think about my choice, I am forced to go right by fear.  From the tunnel where I just crawled from I hear in that warped voice, “daddy lets go home”.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I crawl faster with no light to guide me I feel in front of me as I go.  “Shit shit shit.”, I yell as I hit a dead end.  Trying to peer through the black, regretting my choice to enter this fucking cave to begin with.  Idk if it was my eyes adjusting to the dark, or a hole opening up but I saw a dim light above me where there was once only rock and dark.  Taking my chances with my unknown exit or that thing behind me I would take the latter.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I crawl up and begin to climb towards the opening, hoping I fit.  As I reach the opening, I feel sweet relief come over me.  Then something grabs my ankle pulling me into the tunnel.  “Dad, don’t leave me.”, in her voice.  I scream and pull as hard as I can, feeling its grip tighten but seeing only a shadow.  I muster the strength to pull my way out.  Crawling backwards till my back reaches a wall.  The shadow figure climbs out of the tunnel, walking slowly to me.  “Dad lets…” it is cut off by a screech.  The shadow figure retreats to the tunnel in an almost rewinding movement.  I hear my daughters echo from the tunnel fading.
I come to my feet, slowly making my way to the tunnel.  Practically dragging my feet, I peer down.  Just pure black, nothing to see.  I step back breathing a sigh of relief, thinking to myself.  “why the hell did it run away?”.  I turn to look at my surroundings, with a huge laugh I smile.  There is snow!!! The sky is blue, I am home.  All the joy in the world was sucked out of me when I looked at the cliff wall.  There was writing on the wall, more like carvings or petroglyphs.  Weird symbols hoops, swirls and humanoid things with horns.  “Where the hell am I?”, I mutter.  My vision blurs and I collapse on the floor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wake to darkness outside and find myself next to a fire, covered by a tattered blanket and animal skin makeshift pillow.  Sitting up examining my surrounding, it is night time and no moon in the sky.  I am still on the ledge next to the tunnel, the area looks exactly the same as the previous place I crawled out of but the environment felt normal.  No thick air, no strange hew.  The fire cast shadows, on the wall making the petroglyphs look more ominous than before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My concentration broken by footsteps approaching.  I stand with fear and anticipation, as I peer just beyond the light of the fire.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the darkness a figure appears covered in animal skins, walking upright yet broken manner dragging one leg behind it.  I stare in fear as it lays down a coyote carcass……”eat.”, it gasp.&lt;/p&gt;

It supposedly served over 180 different types of whiskeys that we were all very eager to try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As per usual, the night began with me procrastinating at my house, as I try to cram in one last episode of Stranger Things before I have to get ready. Though, in my defense, it was the last episode of the season and I was the only one of my friends who hadn&amp;#39;t finished it yet. So as I was sure the topic would come up at some point and I did not want any of my big mouth friends spoiling the ending for me, I watched all the way through. Simultaneously buttoning up my shirt right as Will Byers was being pulled out of the upside-down. Then I grab my phone and quickly schedule an Uber to pick me up. Just in time too, with a two minute ETA message on the Uber app being directly followed by a text from my friend Caleb, asking me where I was at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He and most of the others had apparently already been at the bar for over half an hour, and were starting to wonder when I would be meeting up with them there. Guess I was running a bit more late than I had anticipated, as always.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I check my phone a few times before the Uber arrives, making sure that the driver isn&amp;#39;t outside waiting for me yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I briefly glance through his profile, seeing a weathered experience of 1,921 rides at a nearly four star rating in a 2017 dark red Toyota Camry. Only a single word was listed for his profile name, and I wasn&amp;#39;t sure if it was his real name or an alias. It read &amp;quot;Beaumont&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app showed that the he was now approaching my house. So I slid my phone into my pocket and proceeded to walk outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My neighbor&amp;#39;s dogs are barking against the fence next door as I walk across the yard over to the sidewalk. The sky is dark and the road is clear of traffic, until I see a brightening set of headlights leading around the corner to my street. It moves in alignment with the little car icon on the Uber app, emerging as the dark red Toyota Camry here to pick me up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I flag the car over, enticing the driver to pull off to the sidewalk, where I&amp;#39;m met by a large man in thick, oversized glasses, leaning into the passenger seat to greet me. Though he doesn&amp;#39;t say anything, he paints a very visual smile after we make eye contact. He then motions for me to open the door to the back seat, waving his noticeably hairy arms towards the door handle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You Beaumont?&amp;quot; I ask, feeling saying saying it out loud on the basis of using an alias in a professional manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of responding, he nods his head impatiently and motions the same arm-flailing signal for me to get in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever. It&amp;#39;s just a 10 minute ride to the bar. Who cares if the driver act weirdly and resembles the sort of a blind gorilla with zero social skills. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get in and click on my seatbelt, all while he remains competent immobile. His arm rested on the passenger seat, reached back to the door, hugging the seat. I get comfortable and return my eyes to his, with a friendly &amp;quot;ready&amp;quot;, hoping it&amp;#39;s the confirmation he&amp;#39;s waiting on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He continues smiling for an extended moment before drawing his arm back to nudge his glasses from sliding down his nose. Then finally straightening out to shift gears and start driving. All without saying a single word. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just from our short (practically non-existent) interaction I could already gather that this was the type of guy who lived alone, and likely has for a long time. Long enough to lose the inherit skills it takes to manage basic human encounters, such as successfully driving a stranger into town. I found it hard to imagine someone like this ever opting for a customer service job like Uber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So how&amp;#39;s it goin&amp;#39;, man?&amp;quot; I politely ask to break the awkwardness. But my small talk goes annoyingly ignored, without any acknowledgment.m whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You get a lotta rides today?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;........&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, nothing. Just a slow lift of his arm, as he again nudges his glasses and then sneaks a glance at me through the rear view mirror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, whatever. I&amp;#39;ll just keep to myself and bury my head in my phone for the rest of the way and I&amp;#39;ll soon forget about the creep sitting behind the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I end up opening my emails and clearing out all the spam I&amp;#39;ve accumulated in my inbox. Even digging deep enough into a few of them to officially unsubscribe from receiving any future junk emails. I work my way from nearly 300 to 139 separate emails by the time I lift my eyes up from the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a second I almost forget about the driver until I scan to the road outside the front windshield and catch him staring at me in the mirror for a second time, and who knows for how long. How long he&amp;#39;s struggled to get a good look at me between the two inch thick pane of lenses that sits at the tip of his nose, waiting to be nudged back into place and his somehow filthy, obnoxiously crooked rear view mirror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I choose to ignore it, however, and return to my phone&amp;#39;s dwindling email stash. But I only manage to rummage through 3 or 4 of them before I become more increasingly alert to his continuous stare. At that point, it was actually beginning to bother me. Though I tried not to draw any attention to my concern, since the last thing I wanted was to do something that may cause him to act even creepier. And that&amp;#39;s when I received another text from Caleb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dude, where the hell are you???&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read the message and only then noticed what time it was. It had been 22 minutes since I left the house. More than double the time it takes to get downtown. Even with traffic, which there was absolutely none of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weird... I started doubting my judgement of far away his bar actually was from my house. But then I remembered scrolling through the Uber app and seeing the 10 minute trip duration. I opening up the app again and checked. What I thought was a 10 minute trip was now reading that we were 38 minutes away from the destination. That can&amp;#39;t be right, I thought to myself.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Excuse me, sir. How close are we?&amp;quot; I ask in an inaccurately patient tone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I receive no response. In fact, my question only triggers him to turn his eyes away from the mirror. Not that I minded that he finally stopped glaring at me, but it was obvious that he was deliberately ignoring me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The car slows down as we come up on a stop sign and ease into complete idle for what lasts unusually longer than the typical 3 second pause. Nothing but the soft hum of the engine fills the air as we both sit motionless in the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Where are you going???&amp;quot; I say, revealing a more accurately irritable tone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He sits unresponsive, driving steadily down the dark road. Then somewhere in the heavy silence we awkwardly shared inside the car, I heard a thud. A muffled low noise that I couldn&amp;#39;t quite locate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a second I forget about his unresponsiveness and tilt my head to hone in the sound and hear it again. But I&amp;#39;m still unable to pick up where it&amp;#39;s coming from. I&amp;#39;m now twisting my body in my seat in a more visible attempt at better hearing the noise. And that&amp;#39;s when the driver starts acting suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He first presses his finger to the center console, powering on the radio to a default alternative rock station. As soon as I look over to him, I see his eyes shift back to the mirror for a split second, then back towards the road. He slides his glasses back up his nose and continues to drive as if everything is normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What&amp;#39;re you doing??&amp;quot; I ask in a definite reference to his driving abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He doesn&amp;#39;t look over at all, but instead turns the volume knob up a quarter rotation louder. I can tell that he&amp;#39;s not really enjoying the song, so I&amp;#39;m just gonna assume that he&amp;#39;s trying to drown out the noise, or maybe just distract me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m beyond uneasy now, with my ears struggling for the slightest hint of hearing the noise again. But it was so faint to begin with that only in the midst of the awkward silence could it be noticed at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decide to forget about the noise and get back to questioning the driver&amp;#39;s route. I go so far as to smack the head rest on the backside of his seat to get his attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally become so aggravated that I demand he stop the car and let me out. I&amp;#39;m so weirded out that I don&amp;#39;t even care if I have to walk the rest of the way. I just wanted out of this red Toyota Camry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He neglects to utter a single word, repainting the long smile on his face as he rolls his eyes back over to the mirror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I become so frustrated with his silence that I literally demand him to stop the car and let me out. It&amp;#39;s all for not though, as he simply raises his hairy arm and arrogantly curves the mirror, aiming it more directly at me without giving a response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s when I hear the noise again, this time louder. I figure it out to be in the trunk behind me, as I feel a slight vibration in my seat from the sound that I&amp;#39;ve now identified as something pounding against it. My reaction to the sound only causes him to turn the radio up even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get caught up in the moment and lock my eyes towards the mirror to stare the driver down as I smack my fist into the seat, shooting an unwavering gaze into the mirror&amp;#39;s reflection in a stare-down with the driver that conveys an intolerance to his behavior. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, as if my banging the seat behind me had enticed a conversation, I heard something more prominent than the previous thud I heard before. This noise was similar in its low, muffled filter. But it was more of a weak whimpering sound that only lasted for a split second. It was instantaneous, yet it echoed inside my head in an eerie reverberation that unsettled me more with every repetition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The noise now ringing in my head, pulsating in an increasingly building anxiety began to set itself into reality. I grew more than suspecting towards the activity in the trunk. I became concerned that there was actually someone trapped inside. Someone that the driver didn&amp;#39;t want me becoming aware of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thought circulated in my head, and I admittedly started feeling nervous. As if I was so suddenly aware of the driver&amp;#39;s intentions and capabilities in the darkest of ways. I start to wonder if whoever was hidden in the trunk was hurt. They could even be near death, hitting the back of my seat with every bit of energy they had left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I unclench my fist and lower it from the back of the seat. The driver continues watching me in the mirror and gives his glasses another nudge up his nose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thoughts run wild. Maybe he&amp;#39;s planning on putting me in the trunk as well. That would explain why this 10 minute ride has taken more than half an hour and how I still don&amp;#39;t recognize the surroundings outside the car. So I doubt we&amp;#39;re even headed in the bar&amp;#39;s direction at all. Maybe he&amp;#39;s only using Uber as a trap to bail unsuspecting people like me into getting into his car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two sides of my brain argue between my stupidity for putting myself in this situation with a complete stranger so willingly and the ridiculousness of my jump to conclusions that he had even done anything wrong at all. I could&amp;#39;ve let my mind race all I wanted, but I knew that unless I actually looked into the trunk, there was no way of truly knowing what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the questions remains: Do I look for a quick escape or do I act normal and hope for the best? I have to admit, it would be embarrassing if I acted on a hunch and turned out to be completely wrong. But on the other hand, what if I&amp;#39;m not wrong and he really is planning something insidious?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of my dreadful pondering only managed to work up a deep rooted nervousness in my bones. Soon the palms of my hands were sweating, along with a few beads slowly trickling down my forehead. I couldn&amp;#39;t help but fearful analyze the aggressive attitude I shot towards the driver and worry that I&amp;#39;ve given him too much reason to do something terrible. That is assuming that something terrible wasn&amp;#39;t already a part of his plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I become so worried that I feared making even the smallest movement. All the while he&amp;#39;s driving through narrow inner-city streets, looking back at me through the mirror and holding his grim smile wide across his fat face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The song playing on the radio eventually comes to an anticipated end, as the heavily distorted guitars ring out from the final chorus. The music fades and the quiet returns, building up to a painfully uncomfortable silence that fills the car until the next song starts. The smile falls from his face as he sharpens his stare, looking more diligently focused on me than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t dare speak. I try not to even move. But I soon hear a voice all the same. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a voice from inside the trunk, sounding more clearly audible now when it cries out in the one plea I reluctantly anticipated I&amp;#39;d hear... it&amp;#39;s a cry for help. It&amp;#39;s an invisible scream as the low banging against the back seat returns in a more furious pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see a tone shift in the driver&amp;#39;s stare as I visibly react to the cry that I can no longer pretend not to hear. I wear a panicked facade on my entire body that the driver unmistakably picks up on, with his hairy arms reaching for the mirror to move it along to my anxious squirming. He leans forward to get a closer look at my reflection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The banging continues and I know I have to act fast if I&amp;#39;m gonna get out of this. So I look up at the driver and place my hand over my seatbelt buckle. He tried to shift his eyes down to see it, and although the buckle is outside of his line of sight, the wrinkling of his head above his eyebrows tells me he&amp;#39;s getting angry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next song chimes on with a fast paced drum fill that scores the pounding on the back of my seat and incessant screaming that both the driver and I are listening to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see us approaching a stop sign in the background of the driver&amp;#39;s stare and mentally prepare myself to bolt out the door and run. My grip on the seatbelt buckle tightens as I apply increased pressure on the plastic red release button. We reach the stop sign but don&amp;#39;t slow down. In fact, he begins to accelerate and proceeds to drive straight through without any hesitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I choose not to react. The driver himself doesn&amp;#39;t so much as blink in my direction, minus his eyes twitching as he nudges his glasses back up again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My phone goes off again with what I assume is another text message from Caleb, asking me where I am. There&amp;#39;s no time for me to look though. I have to swallow my fear and get the hell out of this car, while I still can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I do something that felt crazy. And I do so quickly, before I give myself enough time to realize just how crazy it actually is. With the driver&amp;#39;s full focus through the rear view mirror, I suddenly press down on the red button. Resulting in a loud click and the swiping sound of the seatbelt dragging back into its holster. While I throw myself into the door handle, pushing it open with my shoulder, and tumbling out of the moving car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I roll out onto the pavement, tossing faster than I have time to react and ride the force of my 45 mph impact. As I roll I hear the screeching of the car&amp;#39;s brakes ahead. I come to battered stop and see the car now lining up to turn around. I look down to see scraps and scuffs all across my arms and elbows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I Lunge myself up off the ground and start to run away as the car charges in my direction. I turn a corner around the intersection and nearly pile into a couple security guards emerging from what looked like the back door of a small bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The car is about to turn the corner when the driver sees the unanticipated company. I can see the sudden fear in his face as he swings his hurt arms across the steering wheel and straightens the car back down the street we originally came from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two security guards look puzzled by the driver&amp;#39;s speeding and frantic maneuvering. As well as all the fresh scuffs swelling along my arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The throbbing begins to set in while I watch the dark red Toyota Camry slink away down the road and I don&amp;#39;t bother reading the license plate. I don&amp;#39;t have to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Everything alright, kid?&amp;quot; One of the the guards asks. He takes a step forward to get a better look at my arms. &amp;quot;You okay?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I take a look around the block I&amp;#39;m standing on and realize that I&amp;#39;m in a part of town I&amp;#39;ve never been to before. I then respond in a shaky tone and ask if they can call the police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The police arrive shortly after, followed by an ambulance who wrap the cuts on my arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I share the driver&amp;#39;s Uber profile with an officer who tells me that he&amp;#39;ll do everything he can to find him. I explain everything that happened, including the sounds I heard coming from inside the trunk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And do you know what was in the trunk?&amp;quot; He asked me as he&amp;#39;s writing everything down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No idea...&amp;quot; I say, trying to imagine how the person trapped inside the trunk of a psychopath&amp;#39;s car must feel. The overwhelming panic they must be in. I can feel my palms getting sweaty again just thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been about 5 months now and I haven&amp;#39;t heard anything back from the police. I&amp;#39;ve looked for his profile in the Uber app several times and haven&amp;#39;t found it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be surprised if they ever find him. So if that day never comes, I&amp;#39;ll have to continue wracking my brain with the thought of whatever he was planning to do with whoever it was he had in the trunk, and if they were even still alive. And on top of that, I can&amp;#39;t help but wonder where he was taking me. Either way, I hope I never find out...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;m never riding Uber again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;
                                            [selftext] => A few of my friends were meeting up at a newly opened whiskey bar downtown, called "The Garage". It supposedly served over 180 different types of whiskeys that we were all very eager to try.

As per usual, the night began with me procrastinating at my house, as I try to cram in one last episode of Stranger Things before I have to get ready. Though, in my defense, it was the last episode of the season and I was the only one of my friends who hadn't finished it yet. So as I was sure the topic would come up at some point and I did not want any of my big mouth friends spoiling the ending for me, I watched all the way through. Simultaneously buttoning up my shirt right as Will Byers was being pulled out of the upside-down. Then I grab my phone and quickly schedule an Uber to pick me up. Just in time too, with a two minute ETA message on the Uber app being directly followed by a text from my friend Caleb, asking me where I was at.

He and most of the others had apparently already been at the bar for over half an hour, and were starting to wonder when I would be meeting up with them there. Guess I was running a bit more late than I had anticipated, as always.

I check my phone a few times before the Uber arrives, making sure that the driver isn't outside waiting for me yet.

I briefly glance through his profile, seeing a weathered experience of 1,921 rides at a nearly four star rating in a 2017 dark red Toyota Camry. Only a single word was listed for his profile name, and I wasn't sure if it was his real name or an alias. It read "Beaumont". 

The app showed that the he was now approaching my house. So I slid my phone into my pocket and proceeded to walk outside.

My neighbor's dogs are barking against the fence next door as I walk across the yard over to the sidewalk. The sky is dark and the road is clear of traffic, until I see a brightening set of headlights leading around the corner to my street. It moves in alignment with the little car icon on the Uber app, emerging as the dark red Toyota Camry here to pick me up.

I flag the car over, enticing the driver to pull off to the sidewalk, where I'm met by a large man in thick, oversized glasses, leaning into the passenger seat to greet me. Though he doesn't say anything, he paints a very visual smile after we make eye contact. He then motions for me to open the door to the back seat, waving his noticeably hairy arms towards the door handle.

"You Beaumont?" I ask, feeling saying saying it out loud on the basis of using an alias in a professional manner.

Instead of responding, he nods his head impatiently and motions the same arm-flailing signal for me to get in.

Whatever. It's just a 10 minute ride to the bar. Who cares if the driver act weirdly and resembles the sort of a blind gorilla with zero social skills. 

I get in and click on my seatbelt, all while he remains competent immobile. His arm rested on the passenger seat, reached back to the door, hugging the seat. I get comfortable and return my eyes to his, with a friendly "ready", hoping it's the confirmation he's waiting on.

He continues smiling for an extended moment before drawing his arm back to nudge his glasses from sliding down his nose. Then finally straightening out to shift gears and start driving. All without saying a single word. 

Just from our short (practically non-existent) interaction I could already gather that this was the type of guy who lived alone, and likely has for a long time. Long enough to lose the inherit skills it takes to manage basic human encounters, such as successfully driving a stranger into town. I found it hard to imagine someone like this ever opting for a customer service job like Uber.

"So how's it goin', man?" I politely ask to break the awkwardness. But my small talk goes annoyingly ignored, without any acknowledgment.m whatsoever.

"You get a lotta rides today?"

........

Still, nothing. Just a slow lift of his arm, as he again nudges his glasses and then sneaks a glance at me through the rear view mirror.

Once again, whatever. I'll just keep to myself and bury my head in my phone for the rest of the way and I'll soon forget about the creep sitting behind the wheel.

I end up opening my emails and clearing out all the spam I've accumulated in my inbox. Even digging deep enough into a few of them to officially unsubscribe from receiving any future junk emails. I work my way from nearly 300 to 139 separate emails by the time I lift my eyes up from the screen.

For a second I almost forget about the driver until I scan to the road outside the front windshield and catch him staring at me in the mirror for a second time, and who knows for how long. How long he's struggled to get a good look at me between the two inch thick pane of lenses that sits at the tip of his nose, waiting to be nudged back into place and his somehow filthy, obnoxiously crooked rear view mirror.

I choose to ignore it, however, and return to my phone's dwindling email stash. But I only manage to rummage through 3 or 4 of them before I become more increasingly alert to his continuous stare. At that point, it was actually beginning to bother me. Though I tried not to draw any attention to my concern, since the last thing I wanted was to do something that may cause him to act even creepier. And that's when I received another text from Caleb.

"Dude, where the hell are you???"

I read the message and only then noticed what time it was. It had been 22 minutes since I left the house. More than double the time it takes to get downtown. Even with traffic, which there was absolutely none of.

Weird... I started doubting my judgement of far away his bar actually was from my house. But then I remembered scrolling through the Uber app and seeing the 10 minute trip duration. I opening up the app again and checked. What I thought was a 10 minute trip was now reading that we were 38 minutes away from the destination. That can't be right, I thought to myself.  

"Excuse me, sir. How close are we?" I ask in an inaccurately patient tone.

But I receive no response. In fact, my question only triggers him to turn his eyes away from the mirror. Not that I minded that he finally stopped glaring at me, but it was obvious that he was deliberately ignoring me.

The car slows down as we come up on a stop sign and ease into complete idle for what lasts unusually longer than the typical 3 second pause. Nothing but the soft hum of the engine fills the air as we both sit motionless in the car.

"Where are you going???" I say, revealing a more accurately irritable tone.

He sits unresponsive, driving steadily down the dark road. Then somewhere in the heavy silence we awkwardly shared inside the car, I heard a thud. A muffled low noise that I couldn't quite locate.

For a second I forget about his unresponsiveness and tilt my head to hone in the sound and hear it again. But I'm still unable to pick up where it's coming from. I'm now twisting my body in my seat in a more visible attempt at better hearing the noise. And that's when the driver starts acting suspicious.

He first presses his finger to the center console, powering on the radio to a default alternative rock station. As soon as I look over to him, I see his eyes shift back to the mirror for a split second, then back towards the road. He slides his glasses back up his nose and continues to drive as if everything is normal.

"What're you doing??" I ask in a definite reference to his driving abilities.

He doesn't look over at all, but instead turns the volume knob up a quarter rotation louder. I can tell that he's not really enjoying the song, so I'm just gonna assume that he's trying to drown out the noise, or maybe just distract me.

I'm beyond uneasy now, with my ears struggling for the slightest hint of hearing the noise again. But it was so faint to begin with that only in the midst of the awkward silence could it be noticed at all.

I decide to forget about the noise and get back to questioning the driver's route. I go so far as to smack the head rest on the backside of his seat to get his attention.

I finally become so aggravated that I demand he stop the car and let me out. I'm so weirded out that I don't even care if I have to walk the rest of the way. I just wanted out of this red Toyota Camry.

He neglects to utter a single word, repainting the long smile on his face as he rolls his eyes back over to the mirror.

I become so frustrated with his silence that I literally demand him to stop the car and let me out. It's all for not though, as he simply raises his hairy arm and arrogantly curves the mirror, aiming it more directly at me without giving a response.

That's when I hear the noise again, this time louder. I figure it out to be in the trunk behind me, as I feel a slight vibration in my seat from the sound that I've now identified as something pounding against it. My reaction to the sound only causes him to turn the radio up even more.

I get caught up in the moment and lock my eyes towards the mirror to stare the driver down as I smack my fist into the seat, shooting an unwavering gaze into the mirror's reflection in a stare-down with the driver that conveys an intolerance to his behavior. 

Then, as if my banging the seat behind me had enticed a conversation, I heard something more prominent than the previous thud I heard before. This noise was similar in its low, muffled filter. But it was more of a weak whimpering sound that only lasted for a split second. It was instantaneous, yet it echoed inside my head in an eerie reverberation that unsettled me more with every repetition.

The noise now ringing in my head, pulsating in an increasingly building anxiety began to set itself into reality. I grew more than suspecting towards the activity in the trunk. I became concerned that there was actually someone trapped inside. Someone that the driver didn't want me becoming aware of.

The thought circulated in my head, and I admittedly started feeling nervous. As if I was so suddenly aware of the driver's intentions and capabilities in the darkest of ways. I start to wonder if whoever was hidden in the trunk was hurt. They could even be near death, hitting the back of my seat with every bit of energy they had left.

I unclench my fist and lower it from the back of the seat. The driver continues watching me in the mirror and gives his glasses another nudge up his nose.

My thoughts run wild. Maybe he's planning on putting me in the trunk as well. That would explain why this 10 minute ride has taken more than half an hour and how I still don't recognize the surroundings outside the car. So I doubt we're even headed in the bar's direction at all. Maybe he's only using Uber as a trap to bail unsuspecting people like me into getting into his car.

The two sides of my brain argue between my stupidity for putting myself in this situation with a complete stranger so willingly and the ridiculousness of my jump to conclusions that he had even done anything wrong at all. I could've let my mind race all I wanted, but I knew that unless I actually looked into the trunk, there was no way of truly knowing what was going on.

So the questions remains: Do I look for a quick escape or do I act normal and hope for the best? I have to admit, it would be embarrassing if I acted on a hunch and turned out to be completely wrong. But on the other hand, what if I'm not wrong and he really is planning something insidious?

All of my dreadful pondering only managed to work up a deep rooted nervousness in my bones. Soon the palms of my hands were sweating, along with a few beads slowly trickling down my forehead. I couldn't help but fearful analyze the aggressive attitude I shot towards the driver and worry that I've given him too much reason to do something terrible. That is assuming that something terrible wasn't already a part of his plan.

I become so worried that I feared making even the smallest movement. All the while he's driving through narrow inner-city streets, looking back at me through the mirror and holding his grim smile wide across his fat face.

The song playing on the radio eventually comes to an anticipated end, as the heavily distorted guitars ring out from the final chorus. The music fades and the quiet returns, building up to a painfully uncomfortable silence that fills the car until the next song starts. The smile falls from his face as he sharpens his stare, looking more diligently focused on me than ever.

I don't dare speak. I try not to even move. But I soon hear a voice all the same. 

It's a voice from inside the trunk, sounding more clearly audible now when it cries out in the one plea I reluctantly anticipated I'd hear... it's a cry for help. It's an invisible scream as the low banging against the back seat returns in a more furious pattern.

I wear a panicked facade on my entire body that the driver unmistakably picks up on, with his hairy arms reaching for the mirror to move it along to my anxious squirming. He leans forward to get a closer look at my reflection.

The banging continues and I know I have to act fast if I'm gonna get out of this. So I look up at the driver and place my hand over my seatbelt buckle. He tried to shift his eyes down to see it, and although the buckle is outside of his line of sight, the wrinkling of his head above his eyebrows tells me he's getting angry.

The next song chimes on with a fast paced drum fill that scores the pounding on the back of my seat and incessant screaming that both the driver and I are listening to.

I see us approaching a stop sign in the background of the driver's stare and mentally prepare myself to bolt out the door and run. My grip on the seatbelt buckle tightens as I apply increased pressure on the plastic red release button. We reach the stop sign but don't slow down.

I come to battered stop and see the car now lining up to turn around. I look down to see scraps and scuffs all across my arms and elbows.

I Lunge myself up off the ground and start to run away as the car charges in my direction. I turn a corner around the intersection and nearly pile into a couple security guards emerging from what looked like the back door of a small bar.

The throbbing begins to set in while I watch the dark red Toyota Camry slink away down the road and I don't bother reading the license plate. I don't have to.

"Everything alright, kid?" One of the the guards asks. He takes a step forward to get a better look at my arms. "You okay?"

I take a look around the block I'm standing on and realize that I'm in a part of town I've never been to before. I then respond in a shaky tone and ask if they can call the police.

The police arrive shortly after, followed by an ambulance who wrap the cuts on my arms.

I share the driver's Uber profile with an officer who tells me that he'll do everything he can to find him. I explain everything that happened, including the sounds I heard coming from inside the trunk.

And I'm never riding Uber again.

&lt;p&gt;“Begin at the beginning”. This time the words were circled lightly in pencil. I had to flick through the book - &lt;em&gt;Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland&lt;/em&gt; - a few times before I spotted them. They were near the back, in the chapter entitled “Alice’s Evidence”. I didn’t know if this was intentional or not, but it seemed fitting; I had hoped that this new message might provide some insights into what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Begin at the beginning&lt;/em&gt; was hardly the sort of thing I was expecting, however. The four words were so vague, without additional context they were as nonsensical as the characters in the book. I went back through the pages, more carefully this time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found just one more circled word – “grave” – in the same chapter, just a few pages prior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frustrated, I tossed the book across my bed. Despite having strained my eyes examining every smudge within the paperback to ensure it wasn’t lead marks, all I was left with were these five cryptic words. The message, if you could call it that, was hardly helpful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Grave” and “Begin at the beginning” might as well have been the Mad Hatter’s riddle, “Why is a raven like a writing-desk”, for all the good it did me. Neither seemed to actually have a solution. I wondered then if the lady at the library wasn’t an ally after all. Perhaps, I was just being toyed with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps, I was the mad one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe the scribblings in this book and in the one I had found in the secret room were nothing more than the work of bored children. I had no proof the initial “message” had been from Jane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I buried my head in my hands. I was running out of time and options. The new girl – my new &lt;em&gt;sister&lt;/em&gt;- was due to arrive within 24 hours. I either had to get the hell out of dodge, and leave the girl to face whatever reality was happening here, or I had to figure out a way to collect some more information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chin cupped in hands, I allowed my gaze to wander back to the book, which now lay askew on the edge of my bed. The cover of the Dover Thrift edition of Carroll’s classic was an annoyingly bright yellow. The shade was such that it caused the red blocky title to jump off the page. It also allowed, I noticed then, for any impurities to stand out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the upper left portion of cover, directly in the path of the illustrated Alice’s gaze, was an odd looking blemish. When I had first looked over the book, I had dismissed it as a regular liquid stain – a byproduct of its many borrowers – but now that I examined it more closely, I saw that its shape was deliberate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thick, half-circle could have easily been mistaken for a water-mark left by a glass, and the lines that radiated from its curve might have been splatters. But, when observed as a whole, the marks came together to form a design. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone cared to stare at the stain long enough and had seen a bird in flight, they might have shrugged and chalked it up to pareidolia. I, on the other hand, was familiar with that particular avian shape. In my forced exploits outdoors, I had seen it often enough. It was the metal dove that marked the entryway to the town cemetery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The smattering of graves was tucked up on a hill just down the dirt road from my house. While it was true that there weren’t all the many living people in close proximity to us, there were certainly plenty of dead ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought about the circled words again, “grave” in particular. Jesus, could they really mean for me to go traipsing through a graveyard? What the hell sort of information could I gleam from bones and stones? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A heavy breath was expelled through my lips, as I gave into the urge to sigh. The cemetery was only fifteen minutes away by foot, and I could easily come up with a reason to “go for a walk”. My parents had, as of late, become a bit laxer in their watching of me; most likely because I had been playing the part of the perfect daughter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really had no excuse not to go. At least if I didn’t find anything, I would know I was chasing ghosts. And if I did manage to find some glimmer of information – well, then I’d be one step closer to the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The snow had begun to melt some, and the air wasn’t quite as chilly, as I made my way down the country road. The sun was out, and I could see in the distance gray specks sprinkled about all the white. The hill where the weathered graveyard lay wasn’t all that steep. As I made my way up its slope, the ancient iron archway came into view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It bore the phrase, &lt;em&gt;“Ad Pacem”&lt;/em&gt;, above which was mounted the metal dove. I had looked up the strange words some years prior, after a voyage to the cemetery, and had discovered they meant “towards peace” in Latin. As I took in the fading names etched in stone, I gave a shudder. I hoped that these people were in a better place, since the one in front of me was desolate and lonely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though I had been to the cemetery before, my stays were always brief, and I had never taken the time to read more than one or two of the old stone markers. Now, I went down each row, carefully examining the inscribed words. I wasn’t sure what I was looking for, but I hoped I’d recognize whatever it was when I saw it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The front of the cemetery contained the oldest graves, the ones that were from the 1800s. I passed by those quickly, as I didn’t think anything that dated would prove useful. Madison, Smith, Williams, the names weren’t ringing any bells. I passed by a few more markers when a large ornate headstone caught my eye. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Owens was printed in large letters across the top of it. Underneath were the names of three people and three sets of dates: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don            March 8, 1946 – July 11, 1979&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matthew   September 14, 1969 – July 11, 1979&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leslie          April 6, 1971 – July 11, 1979&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoever these people were, they had all died on the same day. I tried to summon up what little town history I had knowledge of, but the date didn’t ring any bells. I continued on for a few more headstones when I spotted the date again. This time it resided on the stone of an individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johnny Diggs, the name read, born January 13, 1962, died July 11, 1979. Underneath the name and dates was the epitaph, “Beloved son, victim of the beast”. I stared at the inscription a moment trying to decipher the last bit. “Victim of the beast” might be a line one would expect to read in a fantasy novel, but it hardly seemed befitting of a tombstone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t sure what they meant by beast. Was this man – this teenager – killed by some sort of wild animal? We were out in the wilds of the countryside, but aside from the occasional coyote, there wasn’t much around here that would kill a person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My gaze drifted over to the next headstone, and I froze as I read the name carved there – “Alice Byllings”. A chill that had nothing to do with the weather settled over me. Byllings was Father’s and Mother’s last name. &lt;em&gt;My&lt;/em&gt; last name for all I knew. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took in the rest of what was written, “June 5, 1963 – July 11, 1979, Beloved Daughter”. Though I read and reread the words several times, I had trouble digesting them. The surname was uncommon enough that I knew this was no coincidence. I did some quick calculations, and concluded the girl would have been sixteen when she died. It was close enough to my age to disturb me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people who called themselves my parents had never mentioned anyone named Alice. Granted, they never mentioned Jane or the other girls either. Aside from the newspaper clippings and the names scrawled in the old library book I had found in the hidden room, there were no reminders of any of them in the house. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alice Byllings. Though I had never heard the name spoken, it felt as if it held significance. Could this be what the message in the book was pointing me toward? A few names and a date didn’t seem like much. As I pondered their meaning, I did another sweep of the cemetery checking for July 11, 1979. None of the other graves held that date, and I could find no other inscription of significance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I made my way back toward the house, I racked my brain once more for any local historic tidbits I had memorized. Despite my best efforts I could recall no fire, no storm, no epidemic, no anything that would have occurred on that date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I knew where I might find the answer. The library held in their possession an archive of every paper produced by the &lt;em&gt;Daily Pioneer&lt;/em&gt;, the only newspaper devoted to the goings on of the area. If something had occurred on that date in this town, then they would have written an article about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got Mother to drive me into town under the pretense of needing to return the Alice in Wonderland book. Thankfully she had a hair appointment at a salon a block away and readily agreed to drop me off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made my way into the library and headed straight for the back. This time the librarian’s desk was empty. I considered knocking to summon my mysterious ally, but decided against it for the time being. I slid the Alice book into the drop-off slot and headed to the left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the corner were a few microfilm readers and next to that a series of filing cabinets, which contained the entirety of the Daily Pioneer’s archive. Each drawer was labeled by decade. I pulled out the one marked 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thumbing through the folders, each one tagged by a month and year, I found the one marked July 1979. Carefully extracting it, so as not to drop any of the microfilm stored within, I made my way over to one of the readers. Loading the machine was easy enough - it was sorting through the piles of material that was the hard part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me nearly thirty minutes to find the newspaper from July 12, 1979, and ten additional minutes to find what I was looking for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the second page of that edition of the Daily Pioneer was the headline, “Five Dead in Two Car Accident”. My heart began to race as soon as I saw the words – the number of fatalities aligned with the number of people buried up in the cemetery from that time period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I scanned through the article. “Mr. Owens, 33, was found to be at fault when his truck crossed over the center line striking the vehicle of Johnny Diggs head-on. Owens’ children ages 9 and 8, were passengers in his vehicle at the time of the accident. All four were pronounced dead at the scene. Ms. Byllings, who was a passenger in Mr.Diggs’ car, was transported to the hospital where she succumbed to her injuries.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There wasn’t much else to the block of text. I flipped through a couple more microfilm panels and saw another article from a few days later that referenced the accident. This one, however, had a picture attached to it. It showed what looked to be a funeral service. A crowd of somberly dressed people formed a half circle around two open graves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I squinted trying to make out any of the faces in the crowd. Hitting the zoom button, I nearly tipped my chair over, as I slammed backward in surprise. In retrospect, I suppose I should have expected what I found, given my discovery at the graveyard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set apart from the crowd were four people – two couples by the looks of it. One of the pairs was my parents. Though my mother was only in profile – her tearstained face tucked into the shoulder of my father - I knew it was them.  To their right were another man and woman. The man, big and burly, looked to be supporting the small woman at his side, though both looked as if the world were falling apart around them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read through the attached article, and one more piece of the puzzle fell into place. “Johnny Diggs and Alice Byllings were laid to rest today. Knowing how fond the two were of each other in life, their parents – Mr. Anthony Diggs and wife Kathleen, and Mr. Robert Byllings and wife Elizabeth – decided on a joint ceremony. No date has been set for the burial of Don Owens, whose autopsy has yet to be concluded. Authorities expect the toxicology report to confirm that Mr. Owens was intoxicated at the time of the accident.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I removed the microfilm from the machine I weighed my options. Though I now had physical proof that my parents had been hiding things from me, I had no evidence yet to tie them to Jane or any of the other “missing” girls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A curse tumbled from my lips as I glanced at the clock. I was due to meet back up with Mother in ten minutes. I hurriedly stuffed the film back into its manila folder, and returned the sheath to the appropriate filing cabinet drawer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made for the entrance of the library, and as I passed the section of tall bookshelves set aside for Non-Fiction, I heard a whispered conversation. I glanced into the gap between shelves and saw the tall blue-eyed man conversing with the librarian. Her head was uncovered today, and long wavy locks of blond hair fell about her shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two of them formed an intimate picture – heads bowed closely together, her hand resting gently on his shoulder. Whereas she seemed tense in his presence the other day, today – removed from prying eyes – she seemed at ease with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t make out what they were saying, but their conversation seemed harried and intense. Not wanting to make my presence known to them, and needing to get a move on, I continued to the front door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had five minutes remaining to get to the hair salon – Mother didn’t like to be kept waiting. Somewhere to my left I heard a booming voice. I glanced in that direction and saw a young man dressed in black. He held in his hand a bible, which he waved frantically, as he shouted at passersby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first the words didn’t register, but one in particular garnered my attention. “I said to myself concerning the sons of men, ‘God has surely tested them in order for them to see that they are but beasts.’&amp;quot;
I shivered. &lt;em&gt;Beast&lt;/em&gt; there was that word again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my attention was fully affixed to the zealot, I was no longer paying attention to where I walked. I slammed into a hard surface, and bounced back with an &lt;em&gt;umph&lt;/em&gt;. Gaining my balance, I straightened and saw a broad masculine chest covered by a police uniform. My gaze drifted upward and collided with a pair of large brown eyes. They held an expression of vexation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took in the rest of the man’s face then and realized with a jolt that it belonged to the man in the newspaper article. A one Mr. Anthony Diggs, if memory served me right. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You’d do well to be more careful,” the deep voice was befitting of the large man. It was low and rumbling, and it triggered all sorts of bells and whistles within my mind. The visitor to our house - the dispatcher!  It was the same gruff entity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I swallowed, and found my voice, “Y-yes sir! Sorry about that.” Not wanting to stand a moment longer in his presence, I resumed walking. I’m not sure what his role is in all this, but I’m positive he’s a key player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked a few feet when I got the urge to glance behind me. I did, and saw that the man was staring across the street at the religious fanatic. His expression had morphed into something else entirely –something akin to pride. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made it to the salon with a minute to spare. As I got into the car with Mother she beamed and informed me, “wait till we get home, I have a surprise for you!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I humored her with a smile, but my thoughts were on the long ago car accident, and Alice, and everything else I had seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we pulled up our driveway I spotted Father in the doorway. I froze as I saw he was not alone. Tucked into his side was a little girl, no more than five. Her hair was a mess of brown curls, and her pink polka-dotted dress looked rumpled. Her brown eyes were so big and round that even at a distance I could read the wariness lingering there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mother gave a lilting chuckle, as she turned to me. I wasn’t sure if it was my imagination, but in that moment it sounded if it belonged to someone &lt;em&gt;unbalanced&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Time to meet your new sister,” was all she said, before exiting the car. The door slammed shut, and I sat for a moment there in the silence, panicking and feeling so very alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;

The smattering of graves was tucked up on a hill just down the dirt road from my house. While it was true that there weren’t all the many living people in close proximity to us, there were certainly plenty of dead ones.

I thought about the circled words again, “grave” in particular. Jesus, could they really mean for me to go traipsing through a graveyard? What the hell sort of information could I gleam from bones and stones? 

A heavy breath was expelled through my lips, as I gave into the urge to sigh. The cemetery was only fifteen minutes away by foot, and I could easily come up with a reason to “go for a walk”. My parents had, as of late, become a bit laxer in their watching of me; most likely because I had been playing the part of the perfect daughter. 

I really had no excuse not to go. At least if I didn’t find anything, I would know I was chasing ghosts. And if I did manage to find some glimmer of information – well, then I’d be one step closer to the truth.

The snow had begun to melt some, and the air wasn’t quite as chilly, as I made my way down the country road. The sun was out, and I could see in the distance gray specks sprinkled about all the white. The hill where the weathered graveyard lay wasn’t all that steep. As I made my way up its slope, the ancient iron archway came into view.

It bore the phrase, *“Ad Pacem”*, above which was mounted the metal dove. I had looked up the strange words some years prior, after a voyage to the cemetery, and had discovered they meant “towards peace” in Latin. As I took in the fading names etched in stone, I gave a shudder. I hoped that these people were in a better place, since the one in front of me was desolate and lonely.

Though I had been to the cemetery before, my stays were always brief, and I had never taken the time to read more than one or two of the old stone markers. Now, I went down each row, carefully examining the inscribed words. I wasn’t sure what I was looking for, but I hoped I’d recognize whatever it was when I saw it.

The front of the cemetery contained the oldest graves, the ones that were from the 1800s. I passed by those quickly, as I didn’t think anything that dated would prove useful. Madison, Smith, Williams, the names weren’t ringing any bells. I passed by a few more markers when a large ornate headstone caught my eye. 

Owens was printed in large letters across the top of it. Underneath were the names of three people and three sets of dates: 

**Don            March 8, 1946 – July 11, 1979**

**Matthew   September 14, 1969 – July 11, 1979**

**Leslie          April 6, 1971 – July 11, 1979**

Whoever these people were, they had all died on the same day. I tried to summon up what little town history I had knowledge of, but the date didn’t ring any bells. I continued on for a few more headstones when I spotted the date again. This time it resided on the stone of an individual.

Johnny Diggs, the name read, born January 13, 1962, died July 11, 1979. Underneath the name and dates was the epitaph, “Beloved son, victim of the beast”. I stared at the inscription a moment trying to decipher the last bit. “Victim of the beast” might be a line one would expect to read in a fantasy novel, but it hardly seemed befitting of a tombstone. 

I wasn’t sure what they meant by beast. Was this man – this teenager – killed by some sort of wild animal? We were out in the wilds of the countryside, but aside from the occasional coyote, there wasn’t much around here that would kill a person.

My gaze drifted over to the next headstone, and I froze as I read the name carved there – “Alice Byllings”. A chill that had nothing to do with the weather settled over me. Byllings was Father’s and Mother’s last name. *My* last name for all I knew. 

I took in the rest of what was written, “June 5, 1963 – July 11, 1979, Beloved Daughter”. Though I read and reread the words several times, I had trouble digesting them. The surname was uncommon enough that I knew this was no coincidence. I did some quick calculations, and concluded the girl would have been sixteen when she died. It was close enough to my age to disturb me. 

The people who called themselves my parents had never mentioned anyone named Alice. Granted, they never mentioned Jane or the other girls either. Aside from the newspaper clippings and the names scrawled in the old library book I had found in the hidden room, there were no reminders of any of them in the house. 

Alice Byllings. Though I had never heard the name spoken, it felt as if it held significance. Could this be what the message in the book was pointing me toward? A few names and a date didn’t seem like much. As I pondered their meaning, I did another sweep of the cemetery checking for July 11, 1979. None of the other graves held that date, and I could find no other inscription of significance. 

As I made my way back toward the house, I racked my brain once more for any local historic tidbits I had memorized. Despite my best efforts I could recall no fire, no storm, no epidemic, no anything that would have occurred on that date.

But I knew where I might find the answer. The library held in their possession an archive of every paper produced by the *Daily Pioneer*, the only newspaper devoted to the goings on of the area. If something had occurred on that date in this town, then they would have written an article about it.

I got Mother to drive me into town under the pretense of needing to return the Alice in Wonderland book. Thankfully she had a hair appointment at a salon a block away and readily agreed to drop me off.

I made my way into the library and headed straight for the back. This time the librarian’s desk was empty. I considered knocking to summon my mysterious ally, but decided against it for the time being. I slid the Alice book into the drop-off slot and headed to the left.

In the corner were a few microfilm readers and next to that a series of filing cabinets, which contained the entirety of the Daily Pioneer’s archive. Each drawer was labeled by decade. I pulled out the one marked 1970s.

Thumbing through the folders, each one tagged by a month and year, I found the one marked July 1979. Carefully extracting it, so as not to drop any of the microfilm stored within, I made my way over to one of the readers. Loading the machine was easy enough - it was sorting through the piles of material that was the hard part.

It took me nearly thirty minutes to find the newspaper from July 12, 1979, and ten additional minutes to find what I was looking for. 

On the second page of that edition of the Daily Pioneer was the headline, “Five Dead in Two Car Accident”. My heart began to race as soon as I saw the words – the number of fatalities aligned with the number of people buried up in the cemetery from that time period.

I scanned through the article. “Mr. Owens, 33, was found to be at fault when his truck crossed over the center line striking the vehicle of Johnny Diggs head-on. Owens’ children ages 9 and 8, were passengers in his vehicle at the time of the accident. All four were pronounced dead at the scene. Ms. Byllings, who was a passenger in Mr.Diggs’ car, was transported to the hospital where she succumbed to her injuries.” 

There wasn’t much else to the block of text. I flipped through a couple more microfilm panels and saw another article from a few days later that referenced the accident. This one, however, had a picture attached to it. It showed what looked to be a funeral service. A crowd of somberly dressed people formed a half circle around two open graves. 

I squinted trying to make out any of the faces in the crowd. Hitting the zoom button, I nearly tipped my chair over, as I slammed backward in surprise. In retrospect, I suppose I should have expected what I found, given my discovery at the graveyard.

Set apart from the crowd were four people – two couples by the looks of it. One of the pairs was my parents. Though my mother was only in profile – her tearstained face tucked into the shoulder of my father - I knew it was them.  To their right were another man and woman. The man, big and burly, looked to be supporting the small woman at his side, though both looked as if the world were falling apart around them.

I read through the attached article, and one more piece of the puzzle fell into place. “Johnny Diggs and Alice Byllings were laid to rest today. Knowing how fond the two were of each other in life, their parents – Mr. Anthony Diggs and wife Kathleen, and Mr. Robert Byllings and wife Elizabeth – decided on a joint ceremony. No date has been set for the burial of Don Owens, whose autopsy has yet to be concluded. Authorities expect the toxicology report to confirm that Mr. Owens was intoxicated at the time of the accident.”

As I removed the microfilm from the machine I weighed my options. Though I now had physical proof that my parents had been hiding things from me, I had no evidence yet to tie them to Jane or any of the other “missing” girls.

A curse tumbled from my lips as I glanced at the clock. I was due to meet back up with Mother in ten minutes. I hurriedly stuffed the film back into its manila folder, and returned the sheath to the appropriate filing cabinet drawer. 

I made for the entrance of the library, and as I passed the section of tall bookshelves set aside for Non-Fiction, I heard a whispered conversation. I glanced into the gap between shelves and saw the tall blue-eyed man conversing with the librarian. Her head was uncovered today, and long wavy locks of blond hair fell about her shoulders.

The two of them formed an intimate picture – heads bowed closely together, her hand resting gently on his shoulder. Whereas she seemed tense in his presence the other day, today – removed from prying eyes – she seemed at ease with him.

I couldn’t make out what they were saying, but their conversation seemed harried and intense. Not wanting to make my presence known to them, and needing to get a move on, I continued to the front door.

I had five minutes remaining to get to the hair salon – Mother didn’t like to be kept waiting. Somewhere to my left I heard a booming voice. I glanced in that direction and saw a young man dressed in black. He held in his hand a bible, which he waved frantically, as he shouted at passersby.

At first the words didn’t register, but one in particular garnered my attention. “I said to myself concerning the sons of men, ‘God has surely tested them in order for them to see that they are but beasts.’"
I shivered. *Beast* there was that word again. 

Since my attention was fully affixed to the zealot, I was no longer paying attention to where I walked. I slammed into a hard surface, and bounced back with an *umph*. Gaining my balance, I straightened and saw a broad masculine chest covered by a police uniform. My gaze drifted upward and collided with a pair of large brown eyes. They held an expression of vexation.

 I took in the rest of the man’s face then and realized with a jolt that it belonged to the man in the newspaper article. A one Mr. Anthony Diggs, if memory served me right. 

“You’d do well to be more careful,” the deep voice was befitting of the large man. It was low and rumbling, and it triggered all sorts of bells and whistles within my mind. The visitor to our house - the dispatcher!  It was the same gruff entity. 

I swallowed, and found my voice, “Y-yes sir! Sorry about that.” Not wanting to stand a moment longer in his presence, I resumed walking. I’m not sure what his role is in all this, but I’m positive he’s a key player.

I walked a few feet when I got the urge to glance behind me. I did, and saw that the man was staring across the street at the religious fanatic. His expression had morphed into something else entirely –something akin to pride. 

I made it to the salon with a minute to spare. As I got into the car with Mother she beamed and informed me, “wait till we get home, I have a surprise for you!”

I humored her with a smile, but my thoughts were on the long ago car accident, and Alice, and everything else I had seen.

When we pulled up our driveway I spotted Father in the doorway. I froze as I saw he was not alone. Tucked into his side was a little girl, no more than five. Her hair was a mess of brown curls, and her pink polka-dotted dress looked rumpled. Her brown eyes were so big and round that even at a distance I could read the wariness lingering there.

Mother gave a lilting chuckle, as she turned to me. I wasn’t sure if it was my imagination, but in that moment it sounded if it belonged to someone *unbalanced*. 

“Time to meet your new sister,” was all she said, before exiting the car. The door slammed shut, and I sat for a moment there in the silence, panicking and feeling so very alone.

&lt;p&gt;A popular game usually played amongst children but can expand to any age. A game where one person counts to whatever number desired as the rest of the players hide. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was sixteen at the time, taking care of my neighbors kids as they hung out with my parents across the road. The oldest kid, Mac was twelve while his younger sister was eight. He also had two of his friends over, both around the same age. We were all sitting around the television, flipping through channels, bored out of our minds until they brought up the game of hide and seek. We all agreed to play, but first I called my longtime friend, Riley to come over and play as well. Once she’s settled in, we begin to decide who’s ‘it’ before running off to go hide in the dark. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few games past until one of Mac’s friends, Nate became the seeker and me, Riley, and Mac’s little sister Carley moved upstairs to hide. We had previously turned off the lights before beginning the game and tried our best to maneuver throughout the dark without giving away our location. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended up in Mac and Carley’s older brothers room, he moved out a year ago but still had all of his old furniture set in place. We heard Nate call out that he’s done counting and that he’s beginning to search so we scramble into the connected bathroom and squeeze into the tub. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minutes pass by and we all get tired of standing, wondering if the three boys ended the game without informing us. We all climb out of the tub and grab onto each other as we make our way to the bedroom door when we hear; “Where are you guys?” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carley, in front takes off and hides behind the bed and I run after my friend Riley into the bathroom. Her long, black hair made it harder to find my way back but we reached the tub and climbed in. She stood at the faucet and I peeked out the curtain before looking over to her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was standing straight, staring at me. She wasn’t speaking, hell, it didn’t even look like she was breathing so I whisper her name a few times. I then began to raise my voice until I hear her voice call out from the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My heart fell to my stomach as I stared at the thing that I believed was Riley. I sink down onto the tub floor, and her head follows my movements until I hear the bedroom slam and I quickly ran out of the tub and bawl my eyes out as I flip on all the lights and tell them that Riley was standing in the tub with me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game ended after my outburst and I ended up going home minutes after, not mentioning anything to the parents since I know they wouldn’t believe anyways. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I learned that the older brother played with a ouija board several times in the room and soon became paranoid to even go upstairs in their house to the point that I no longer hang out with the kids. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believe me or not, but I swore that I followed Riley to the bathtub and that she was standing in front of me. Only, it wasn’t her and I never want to find out who or what it was. &lt;/p&gt;

                                            [selftext] => Hide and Seek.

A popular game usually played amongst children but can expand to any age. A game where one person counts to whatever number desired as the rest of the players hide. 

I was sixteen at the time, taking care of my neighbors kids as they hung out with my parents across the road. The oldest kid, Mac was twelve while his younger sister was eight. He also had two of his friends over, both around the same age. We were all sitting around the television, flipping through channels, bored out of our minds until they brought up the game of hide and seek. We all agreed to play, but first I called my longtime friend, Riley to come over and play as well. Once she’s settled in, we begin to decide who’s ‘it’ before running off to go hide in the dark. 

A few games past until one of Mac’s friends, Nate became the seeker and me, Riley, and Mac’s little sister Carley moved upstairs to hide. We had previously turned off the lights before beginning the game and tried our best to maneuver throughout the dark without giving away our location. 

We ended up in Mac and Carley’s older brothers room, he moved out a year ago but still had all of his old furniture set in place. We heard Nate call out that he’s done counting and that he’s beginning to search so we scramble into the connected bathroom and squeeze into the tub. 

Minutes pass by and we all get tired of standing, wondering if the three boys ended the game without informing us. We all climb out of the tub and grab onto each other as we make our way to the bedroom door when we hear; “Where are you guys?” 

Carley, in front takes off and hides behind the bed and I run after my friend Riley into the bathroom. Her long, black hair made it harder to find my way back but we reached the tub and climbed in. She stood at the faucet and I peeked out the curtain before looking over to her. 

She was standing straight, staring at me. She wasn’t speaking, hell, it didn’t even look like she was breathing so I whisper her name a few times. I then began to raise my voice until I hear her voice call out from the room.

My heart fell to my stomach as I stared at the thing that I believed was Riley. I sink down onto the tub floor, and her head follows my movements until I hear the bedroom slam and I quickly ran out of the tub and bawl my eyes out as I flip on all the lights and tell them that Riley was standing in the tub with me. 

The game ended after my outburst and I ended up going home minutes after, not mentioning anything to the parents since I know they wouldn’t believe anyways. 

Eventually, I learned that the older brother played with a ouija board several times in the room and soon became paranoid to even go upstairs in their house to the point that I no longer hang out with the kids. 

Believe me or not, but I swore that I followed Riley to the bathtub and that she was standing in front of me. Only, it wasn’t her and I never want to find out who or what it was.

I spent a great deal of my psychology degree studying psychoanalytical theory of dreams, and I&amp;#39;ve always gobbled up dream research from any scholarly journal I could find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why, even though it always seemed like woo-woo to me, I started exploring lucid dreaming a few years ago. If you&amp;#39;re unfamiliar with the term, essentially lucid dreaming is a practice by which you can control your dreams. Sometimes people get to this level of sleeping consciousness accidentally, like a switch gets flipped when they go to sleep. These are the dreams you might find where you realize you&amp;#39;re dreaming but instead of waking up abruptly, you try flying and realize you can. People like me, we practice the art of consciously inducing lucid dreamstates. This can be done by practicing dream recall (I keep a journal by the bed to write down my dreams every time I wake up). After a few weeks of this, you realize you wake up FAR more than you realize, and that you dream probably significantly more than you ever remember. I discovered that most of my dreams are mundane. but there were some that, when upon reviewing my dream journal in the morning, made me scoff, or laugh, or blush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then after a few months of this, it made it easier to maintain a level of awareness in dreams, and once I realized I was dreaming, I could count backwards from 10, and more often than not, stay dreaming and yet mentally awake. It was through repeated exercise of this stuff that I realized there were so many layers to dreaming that it was both exciting and scary. It&amp;#39;s really a lot like th movie Inception, except not hip - you say &amp;quot;lucid dreaming&amp;quot; to most people and they either don&amp;#39;t know what you&amp;#39;re talking about or they think you&amp;#39;re a crystal-rubbing new age hippy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, what i mean by layers is just that - dreaming is like a striated cake. The first few layers are all biological; you close your eyes but you might be startled awake because your basic defensive systems are still pretty alert. I guess this is layer 1. In this state, you might even dream, but it&amp;#39;s more like your mind wandering. Boring. And when I speak of these layers, they line up - at least the first few - with a psychological and biological understanding of sleep and dreaming. Most psychologists will describe 5 stages of sleep, and while these coincide with what I&amp;#39;m talking about a bit, I&amp;#39;m talking about something distinctly different, though superficially similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Layer 2 is when your physical body is paralyzed by your mind, but you can start dreaming. Sometimes this part gets messed up, though, and you can dream but your physical body is still somewhat aware. I would call this &amp;quot;twilight sleep&amp;quot;, as you&amp;#39;re not fully asleep and yet very much not completely aware. This is the stage of dream that many people would be familiar with if you&amp;#39;ve ever experienced sleep paralysis, or &amp;quot;hagging&amp;quot;. The feeling that you&amp;#39;ve got a witch or demon or something sitting on your chest and you want to push them off but your muscles are out of your control. Maybe you finally &amp;quot;get free&amp;quot; by pushing them off, a titanic effort if you&amp;#39;ve ever experienced it, but then you&amp;#39;re awake. Again, I&amp;#39;m no expert, but I would say that 99% of sleep paralysis or hagging is completely biologically &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; in that it fits within the parameters of &amp;quot;reality&amp;quot;. What I&amp;#39;m saying is it&amp;#39;s not ever really a ghost or demon, just your brain being crossed up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Layer 3 is where we start to separate the mind from the brain from the body. When you enter REM sleep, your body should be fully paralyzed and you should experience dreaming. This is also where scientists believe we get the most &amp;quot;quality sleep&amp;quot;, as your brain can review the day and your body should be in repair mode. This is also where some intense dreaming can happen, and the best place to enter lucid dreaming states. This was always my staging ground, so to speak. I would orient myself, realize I was in a dream, count down from 10 and achieve full awareness but this was when I realized that perhaps there was more to dreaming than I realized. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, when you&amp;#39;re dreaming, even lucidly, you&amp;#39;re still an awareness within a construct. So I could fly, shoot fireballs, whatever, but I was still within a reality that was conjured up by my brain. After a instances of being a hero or a villain with an ever-changing landscape within my dreams, I realized that my consciousness was still me. How I perceived my &amp;quot;self&amp;quot; in these dreams - regardless of what I looked like or what the world of the dream was like - was the same. This made me realize that my self, my mind, is distinct from the world my neurons created. Whatever the biological purpose of dreaming is, it&amp;#39;s separate from the dreamer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which leads me to layer 4, and the process of separating my layers of sleep from the conventional &amp;quot;5 stages of sleep&amp;quot; to which science adheres. You see, when you get further along in the 5 stages, you go from wakefulness to deep sleep and return to wakefulness. My observation on dream is that the layers peel back, but they don&amp;#39;t come out the other side by any way save that which you came in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Layer 4 is what appears to be a sort of collective unconsciousness. I&amp;#39;ve traveled to other peoples&amp;#39; dreams, met some other lucid dreamers, and even spoke to dead people. I&amp;#39;ve tested the validity of these claims, by the way. In one instance, I met a woman in a dream who claimed to be named Mary, and who lived in Vermont. We chatted about our experiences, and on a whim, I suggested we exchange phone numbers. We did, and I awoke, quickly jotting the number down. The next day I called it and the woman on the other line didn&amp;#39;t speak for at least a minute after I asked if it was indeed Mary, and told her who I was. We now chat regularly about our experiences, but she has since backed off lucid dreaming, saying she had a bad experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tested the dead person theory as well, though it was far worse an experience. A woman, disheveled and wearing a blood sundress happened to be in my dreams night after night for months. Once, in a dream where I was fighting aliens or something ridiculous, she just walked up to me and told me that she&amp;#39;d killed her baby and herself. I couldn&amp;#39;t tell if she was part of the dream or a separate entity, and she seemed startled when I addressed her directly. She said nobody she&amp;#39;d ever encountered ever reacted, and she told me everything - how she&amp;#39;d drowned her baby in the tub, buried him on the property treeline, and then came back and slit her own wrists. She filled in details about where and when, and I found the property she told me about. Anonymously, I tipped off the police about the location of the baby, and authorities found the remains, just as the woman had told me. I never saw her again after that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s layer 4 - not a big deal, as I think most people experience this level of dreaming probably somewhat often. This also corresponds to intense-but-brief periods of REM sleep, and an easy way to replicate this dreamstate is to deprive yourself of sleep, training your body to get as much recuperative sleep in as short a window as possible. Some people train this way to maximize their effective working time, taking only 3 or 4 one hour naps throughout the day, but still getting &amp;quot;enough&amp;quot; sleep to function well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Layer 5 is when I realized that I was right about my self being independent of my brain and body. Most people can&amp;#39;t seem to achieve this level of dreaming, but the more I explored my dreams, the easier and faster I could enter these layers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What tipped me off that layer 5 was distinct from my normal dreams was the it never changes. Whereas when lucid dreaming, I might be in a sci-fi battlefield, or I might be getting chased by a serial killer whom I then turn around and freeze with magic, layer 5 dreaming was ALWAYS identical. A twilight landscape, mostly brown and muted hills rolling endlessly, lit by purple moonlight that cascaded down from no particular point in the sky. Rarely did I encounter people here; maybe a few other well-traveled somnonauts like me, but they usually only blinked in and out of existence here rarely and only for what felt like a few minutes. They typically looked startled and eager to leave. Myself, I mentally started to keep track of the place. After a while, I had a pretty good hand-drawn map next to my bed, and would make it a point to explore new areas whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Layer 5 is also where I started to encounter non-human beings. Sometimes they&amp;#39;d be whirls of purple-black dust, and sometimes they&amp;#39;d be huge creatures, grazing mutely on the grass that grew here. I learned quickly that regardless of what they looked like, I should never touch or engage with them. The one time I touched one of those whirls, I lost time, and when I woke up, I was sitting in my bathroom with every pill bottle from my cabinet open, pills scattered everywhere and several different ones drying on the roof of my mouth. I made myself throw up immediately and called 911, getting my stomach pumped and freaking out. It was days before I attempted lucid dreaming again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next time I went in, I encountered a human named Devon, who asked if I let &amp;quot;one of them&amp;quot; touch me. I asked how he knew. He pointed at my arm, &amp;quot;there, that&amp;#39;s the mark&amp;quot;. I hadn&amp;#39;t noticed it but my forearm has a jagged, lightning-esque mark on it that glowed slightly purple. He showed me the same on his stomach. &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t know what they are, but if they touch you, they control your body until you can wake up and stop it. I&amp;#39;ve woken up to my wrists slit, my dog in the oven, an empty bottle of pills that I&amp;#39;d taken, all kinds of awful shit&amp;quot;. He nodded when I instinctively touched my scar when he mentioned pills. He pointed at the big, slow creatures grazing. &amp;quot;Those things? All they do is eat - it&amp;#39;s the literal entire consciousness. They don&amp;#39;t even shit, just eat and eat and eat. If one of those gets you, haha&amp;quot;, he patted his stomach. &amp;quot;Those things are why the side effects of some sleep drugs are &amp;#39;sleep eating&amp;#39;. Certain types of sleep meds, they put you down into this place, and sometimes what comes up isn&amp;#39;t, at least at first, what went down.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talked on many other occasions, and on one such occasion, Devon asked if I&amp;#39;d ever gone deeper, and like an idiot, I asked what he meant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m really tired right now so I&amp;#39;m gonna go get a few minutes of sleep, but assuming everything goes well, I will be back to explain my situation a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;

                                            [selftext] => I've always had an interest in the concept of dreaming. I spent a great deal of my psychology degree studying psychoanalytical theory of dreams, and I've always gobbled up dream research from any scholarly journal I could find.

This is why, even though it always seemed like woo-woo to me, I started exploring lucid dreaming a few years ago. If you're unfamiliar with the term, essentially lucid dreaming is a practice by which you can control your dreams. Sometimes people get to this level of sleeping consciousness accidentally, like a switch gets flipped when they go to sleep. These are the dreams you might find where you realize you're dreaming but instead of waking up abruptly, you try flying and realize you can. People like me, we practice the art of consciously inducing lucid dreamstates. This can be done by practicing dream recall (I keep a journal by the bed to write down my dreams every time I wake up). After a few weeks of this, you realize you wake up FAR more than you realize, and that you dream probably significantly more than you ever remember. I discovered that most of my dreams are mundane. but there were some that, when upon reviewing my dream journal in the morning, made me scoff, or laugh, or blush.

Then after a few months of this, it made it easier to maintain a level of awareness in dreams, and once I realized I was dreaming, I could count backwards from 10, and more often than not, stay dreaming and yet mentally awake. It was through repeated exercise of this stuff that I realized there were so many layers to dreaming that it was both exciting and scary. It's really a lot like th movie Inception, except not hip - you say "lucid dreaming" to most people and they either don't know what you're talking about or they think you're a crystal-rubbing new age hippy.

Anyway, what i mean by layers is just that - dreaming is like a striated cake. The first few layers are all biological; you close your eyes but you might be startled awake because your basic defensive systems are still pretty alert. I guess this is layer 1. In this state, you might even dream, but it's more like your mind wandering. Boring. And when I speak of these layers, they line up - at least the first few - with a psychological and biological understanding of sleep and dreaming. Most psychologists will describe 5 stages of sleep, and while these coincide with what I'm talking about a bit, I'm talking about something distinctly different, though superficially similar.

Layer 2 is when your physical body is paralyzed by your mind, but you can start dreaming. Sometimes this part gets messed up, though, and you can dream but your physical body is still somewhat aware. I would call this "twilight sleep", as you're not fully asleep and yet very much not completely aware. This is the stage of dream that many people would be familiar with if you've ever experienced sleep paralysis, or "hagging". The feeling that you've got a witch or demon or something sitting on your chest and you want to push them off but your muscles are out of your control. Maybe you finally "get free" by pushing them off, a titanic effort if you've ever experienced it, but then you're awake. Again, I'm no expert, but I would say that 99% of sleep paralysis or hagging is completely biologically "normal" in that it fits within the parameters of "reality". What I'm saying is it's not ever really a ghost or demon, just your brain being crossed up.

Layer 3 is where we start to separate the mind from the brain from the body. When you enter REM sleep, your body should be fully paralyzed and you should experience dreaming. This is also where scientists believe we get the most "quality sleep", as your brain can review the day and your body should be in repair mode. This is also where some intense dreaming can happen, and the best place to enter lucid dreaming states. This was always my staging ground, so to speak. I would orient myself, realize I was in a dream, count down from 10 and achieve full awareness but this was when I realized that perhaps there was more to dreaming than I realized. 

You see, when you're dreaming, even lucidly, you're still an awareness within a construct. So I could fly, shoot fireballs, whatever, but I was still within a reality that was conjured up by my brain. After a instances of being a hero or a villain with an ever-changing landscape within my dreams, I realized that my consciousness was still me. How I perceived my "self" in these dreams - regardless of what I looked like or what the world of the dream was like - was the same. This made me realize that my self, my mind, is distinct from the world my neurons created. Whatever the biological purpose of dreaming is, it's separate from the dreamer.

Which leads me to layer 4, and the process of separating my layers of sleep from the conventional "5 stages of sleep" to which science adheres. You see, when you get further along in the 5 stages, you go from wakefulness to deep sleep and return to wakefulness. My observation on dream is that the layers peel back, but they don't come out the other side by any way save that which you came in.

Layer 4 is what appears to be a sort of collective unconsciousness. I've traveled to other peoples' dreams, met some other lucid dreamers, and even spoke to dead people. I've tested the validity of these claims, by the way. In one instance, I met a woman in a dream who claimed to be named Mary, and who lived in Vermont. We chatted about our experiences, and on a whim, I suggested we exchange phone numbers. We did, and I awoke, quickly jotting the number down. The next day I called it and the woman on the other line didn't speak for at least a minute after I asked if it was indeed Mary, and told her who I was. We now chat regularly about our experiences, but she has since backed off lucid dreaming, saying she had a bad experience.

I tested the dead person theory as well, though it was far worse an experience. A woman, disheveled and wearing a blood sundress happened to be in my dreams night after night for months. Once, in a dream where I was fighting aliens or something ridiculous, she just walked up to me and told me that she'd killed her baby and herself. I couldn't tell if she was part of the dream or a separate entity, and she seemed startled when I addressed her directly. She said nobody she'd ever encountered ever reacted, and she told me everything - how she'd drowned her baby in the tub, buried him on the property treeline, and then came back and slit her own wrists. She filled in details about where and when, and I found the property she told me about. Anonymously, I tipped off the police about the location of the baby, and authorities found the remains, just as the woman had told me. I never saw her again after that.

That's layer 4 - not a big deal, as I think most people experience this level of dreaming probably somewhat often. This also corresponds to intense-but-brief periods of REM sleep, and an easy way to replicate this dreamstate is to deprive yourself of sleep, training your body to get as much recuperative sleep in as short a window as possible. Some people train this way to maximize their effective working time, taking only 3 or 4 one hour naps throughout the day, but still getting "enough" sleep to function well.

Layer 5 is when I realized that I was right about my self being independent of my brain and body. Most people can't seem to achieve this level of dreaming, but the more I explored my dreams, the easier and faster I could enter these layers. 

What tipped me off that layer 5 was distinct from my normal dreams was the it never changes. Whereas when lucid dreaming, I might be in a sci-fi battlefield, or I might be getting chased by a serial killer whom I then turn around and freeze with magic, layer 5 dreaming was ALWAYS identical. A twilight landscape, mostly brown and muted hills rolling endlessly, lit by purple moonlight that cascaded down from no particular point in the sky. Rarely did I encounter people here; maybe a few other well-traveled somnonauts like me, but they usually only blinked in and out of existence here rarely and only for what felt like a few minutes. They typically looked startled and eager to leave. Myself, I mentally started to keep track of the place. After a while, I had a pretty good hand-drawn map next to my bed, and would make it a point to explore new areas whenever possible.

Layer 5 is also where I started to encounter non-human beings. Sometimes they'd be whirls of purple-black dust, and sometimes they'd be huge creatures, grazing mutely on the grass that grew here. I learned quickly that regardless of what they looked like, I should never touch or engage with them. The one time I touched one of those whirls, I lost time, and when I woke up, I was sitting in my bathroom with every pill bottle from my cabinet open, pills scattered everywhere and several different ones drying on the roof of my mouth. I made myself throw up immediately and called 911, getting my stomach pumped and freaking out. It was days before I attempted lucid dreaming again. 

The next time I went in, I encountered a human named Devon, who asked if I let "one of them" touch me. I asked how he knew. He pointed at my arm, "there, that's the mark". I hadn't noticed it but my forearm has a jagged, lightning-esque mark on it that glowed slightly purple. He showed me the same on his stomach. "Don't know what they are, but if they touch you, they control your body until you can wake up and stop it. I've woken up to my wrists slit, my dog in the oven, an empty bottle of pills that I'd taken, all kinds of awful shit". He nodded when I instinctively touched my scar when he mentioned pills. He pointed at the big, slow creatures grazing. "Those things? All they do is eat - it's the literal entire consciousness. They don't even shit, just eat and eat and eat. If one of those gets you, haha", he patted his stomach. "Those things are why the side effects of some sleep drugs are 'sleep eating'. Certain types of sleep meds, they put you down into this place, and sometimes what comes up isn't, at least at first, what went down." 

We talked on many other occasions, and on one such occasion, Devon asked if I'd ever gone deeper, and like an idiot, I asked what he meant.

I'm really tired right now so I'm gonna go get a few minutes of sleep, but assuming everything goes well, I will be back to explain my situation a bit more.

Women come into this bank-turned-office crying all the time. But the one crying in front of me now wasn&amp;#39;t par for the course. I sensed that this woman&amp;#39;s spirit was like the Titanic, once massive and proud, now broken, sunk, lying in the dark. She wiped her eyes and sniffled for minutes before whispering:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; 
“Mister Moxley...I have a lot of hope in you. I heard that you used to work for the  military....or government, like the X-files or SPC or something like that...” I penciled in a legal pad and turned the pad to her. The note said: “something.” What I said aloud was “No”. The lady read my note and nodded before continuing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; 
“....I also heard you know how to make people who...are...well, who are MORE than human...go away. For good.” I wrote on the next page of my pad. The note said “who do you want to make disappear?” as I said “You are mistaken&amp;quot; loudly enough to satisfy any recorded testimony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
When the lady was done reading my note, I stood and kicked my head back towards the bank vault door behind the mahogany desk and spun the wheel, opening the vault. The women stepped in. As soon as the vault door was latched and spun in place, I knew that nobody could spy on us. &lt;em&gt;Almost&lt;/em&gt; nobody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
When we were both standing in the vault, I asked her who was leaving us. When she answered “my mother”, I asked why, naturally. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
“Because saying “monster” doesn&amp;#39;t cover it. She isolated me my entire life. Not only was I home schooled, but she always kept me five miles south of the middle of nowhere since I was a baby. When we went out to the town, she was always by my side. She even goes into the bathroom with me when we are away from home. She has total control over what I eat, how I exercise, when I sleep and who I should love. And when I &lt;em&gt;DID&lt;/em&gt; fall in love with a man I met, she told me if I ever got pregnant, she would murder us all. That was...years ago. She forbids me to leave the house to live on my own, saying that if I do...she&amp;#39;ll kill me. I always believed her, I saw her kill 2 people by the time I was 30. I tried to get away, I tried to go to the cops and others for help, but that never, ever worked. I swear it&amp;#39;s the will of my mother, she&amp;#39;s the smartest, most observant person on the planet, and I believe she can do more than any one human...and after what I learned today... something has to change. So I demanded answers, today. And...I got them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
The 45 year old lady that walked into my office said her name was Kai...with a name like that, I didn&amp;#39;t doubt that she was home-schooled. But she was articulate. Sharply aware eyed that twinkled with intelligence despite the fatigue and stress. Tall, muscular and beautiful. Smelled like strawberry flowers and fresh laundry. It was a shame to see this beautiful lady so distraught, but I managed to calm her nerves to the point where they were loose enough to let go of her lips to say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; 
“My mother, Cassidy, Cass- she brought me into her bedroom to talk to me about “life” last night. I told her I already knew about biology. Cass tells me that what I read does not apply to me, “to us”. She had a wooden box beside her on the bed when I came in, one I never saw before. My mother and I sat between it and opened it together. Inside were...old...objects. The oldest thing she had was a bowl made from a hallowed out rock.” Kai then spoke her next words in a new voice- the strange &lt;em&gt;wooshing&lt;/em&gt; accent &lt;em&gt;sounded&lt;/em&gt; old. Ancient.  I assume Kai was imitating her mother Cass.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; 
“I carved this bowl twenty thousand years ago...it&amp;#39;s the fourth one I made. My first bowl, made of wood, broke fifty thousand years ago. Now, all I carry are metal and stone momentos. Sturdy. Paper is no good if it turns to dust after five thousand years.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
Kai took a few deep breaths, and asked me again, with no riddles, no half-answers, if I would get rid of this woman. I assured her that her mother would be removed from this world several times. Kai apologized, but her eyes never stopped shifting as she rubbed the sides of her exposed arms. She said she thought she could smell her mother&amp;#39;s perfume. I agreed that I did smell a faint perfume, there was no denying it, but I also explained that the room has closed circulated air that sometimes captures the odors of other clients with enough confidence to make her continue, back to her mother&amp;#39;s imitated accent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
“I was a normal child.  Born on the banks of the river Oor, in what is now Turkey. All of my tribe&amp;#39;s men had been wiped out in a raid, the raiding men succumbing to their wounds soon after. Our tribe was large, over a hundred heads, but it was nothing but women, and we lived for many years by the Oor. I never slept with a man, but around twenty winters, I gave birth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; 
Some of the other women of the tribe feared me for being unnatural, but most welcomed the birth of my daughter as a new member of the tribe. I raised this child, a mirror image of me, just as you are a mirror image of me, until fifty, if I had to guess. No calenders or clocks, but anyone can guess how many times the snows came in their life. I saw about 50 snows before I ate the red spring shoots with the green tips by the river&amp;#39;s mud banks and shit my intestines out by the side of the river over 2 of the most agonizing sunrises of my life. As I was about to die, I could feel the pain of my body leaving while a NEW feeling of life, vigor, strength came over me. One moment, I was beside the river, legs covered in feces with stomach cramps that were almost as painful as childbirth, blinking in and out of wakefulness on a lazy sunny morning...the next moment, I was in my daughter&amp;#39;s body, by the side of the river, picking herbs to help my sick mother. The reflection in the water, my voice proved it and the reactions from the others had proven it- I had become my daughter.” Kai started to cry. There was a fluffy cotton towel in the vault for just that occasion that I handed her. She refused. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
“...My mother said that she helped put her own body on the pyre and buried the bones herself. She never revealed to the others of what happened, and assumed she was her daughter without question. Two winters passed, and during the following spring, my mother was pregnant again. Like before, she birthed and raised another daughter for fifteen years, all without the need for a man, to the growing interest of the tribe. This time, mother&amp;#39;s head was smashed by a wild man when she was journeying alone to collect edible shoots. She found herself back at her daughter&amp;#39;s bed a moment after the rock bashed through her head. Mother said she now had 65 memories of the snow coming, and all the knowledge that came with it, inside of a 15 year old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; 
&amp;quot;Cass would sometimes talk about the magic in the air and the people who could manipulate the very elements of the world when I was a child...but I thought she was musing about the 60&amp;#39;s. No. She was talking about a time where certain women and men knew every action of the earth from its recordings in everyday rocks and leafs. And these people knew what was going on with my mother.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
“She also had a clay tablet written in Sumerian...she wanted to remember what one of these wizened people told her more than 5,000 years ago. My mother shows me a fancy document with intricate gold stamped seals from the 1850&amp;#39;s and lots of loopy signatures saying they verify that the document said the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;amp;nbsp:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Per H.W.W Ganes, translator, 1854: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
1. The creature that you birth is of your exact blood, bones and flesh, in perfect form of the mother. An independent soul grows after immaculate conception in the form of always a daughter, apart from the mother...until the day the mother dies, and the mother is transferred into the flesh of the daughter. The soul of the former daughter is lost forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
2. When the mother dies, her conscious [and the dozens of other words for “conscious” in other languages, some extinct] pushes the “temporary” soul out of the daughter into the void. The mother will find no memories of her daughter in this new body, even during deep soul searching. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
3. There can only be one daughter and one mother. As long as the mother lives, the daughter she bore will not have a child until the mother has died. If the daughter lives past her age of bearing children, both the mother and child will die naturally, and the process ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
4. The daughter cannot bear the children of anyone else, or else the process ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Births are sporadic. The lone mother may become pregnant 1 to 10 years after the soul transfer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
“After reading the translation, a lot of things made sense- like my mother forbidding me to have children. I also understood why she never was afraid to die, and why she never took care of her body while forcing me to stay fit. That&amp;#39;s how she was able to kill- she knew she always had me as a backup.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
“Quite a problem you have” I mused, “Can&amp;#39;t kill her or she&amp;#39;ll be you. That&amp;#39;s why you want her...gone.” Kai nodded. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
“You have to do it quickly Mister Moxley...I learned how to sneak out of my room without my mother knowing along time ago, but My mother can kill herself at any time, and she&amp;#39;s getting worried about my age. I might have seconds left.” I paced around the vault. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
“You mother sounds like a very smart women. Fifty thousand years of living will do that to you. But what I don&amp;#39;t understand is why such a smart woman would tell you anything in the first place if it puts her in jeopardy, especially after all this trouble to keep you in this condition?” Thinking, Kai sucked in her lips until they were a hard line across her face before musing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
“Because I asked her. And...you&amp;#39;re not the first person I came to with this problem. My mother...she&amp;#39;s dangerous. She&amp;#39;s learned every motion needed to subdue ANYONE...I asked a LOT of other people for help. You&amp;#39;re near the end of the list. Maybe she thinks this will get me to stop trying to break free from her?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
I removed the heavy set of keys weighing down the right front pocket of my tattered brown trenchcoat and said: “these keys open doors to places that people can never return back from, and these keys keep those doors locked forever. I will take care of your mother. But return home now. Don&amp;#39;t make her worry.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
Kai hugged me and whispered thank you. It was good to feel genuine love from her. I felt it so little. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
I let her out of the vault and watched her ride away from the office window above, the light from her bike blinking away in the heavy, soft, silent snow before going out completely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
I went back to the vault and opened one of the security boxes that also doubled as a morgue body locker. The gasket was a little loose. It let out the smell of her perfume. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
Inside of it was the body of Cass, sleeping serenely. I was compelled to place my hands on each side of her head, and when I did, I was free. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
I have taken a direct hit from a truck going 40 miles per hour, I have been lit on fire. I have been shot in the shin and slashed across the back with my own machete, poisoned, beaten and survived the vacuum of space for 5 seconds, but &lt;em&gt;none&lt;/em&gt; those things will ever compare to the constant electric shock feeling of getting my own body back as Cass easily rose from the stainless steel slab of the body locker. She rested only feet away from where I spoke to Kai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
Now I remember. Cass, a flabby woman of nearly 70, had amazing technique without needing strength or speed. She had slipped silently into my office an hour before Kai did. She asked if I was Howard Moxley while approaching me with what the police force refers to as “intent”. She was able to disarm me twice. All she needed was a moment to place her hands on the sides of my head. Just as there was no struggle between us physically, there was no struggle between us mentally. Cass pinned my consciousness to the floor with ease as she controlled the body of Ex-Agent H.I Moxley. Cass knew what I knew, knew how to open the vault, knew that there was a place to store her old body while she talked with her daughter as she searched my mind for what secrets I knew. Cass spoke in a bleary waking-up voice while I stayed slumped and paralyzed in agonizing pain against the wall. I was only able to say, ask, the word “how”. Cass spoke in that ancient, wooshing accent that had no traceable modern origin. Kai did its depth no justice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
“Anyone can do what I just did, hopping bodies with just a touch. We all have the ability. But nobody is left who knows how it is done- except me. I was hoping you would have some answers. Hordes and mountains of secrets...but why your mind is an absolute mess, how can you find anything?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&amp;quot;Gin&amp;quot; was all I could erk out. If I was going to die, it was going to be with cryptic joke. Cass didn&amp;#39;t like it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&amp;quot;I wasted too much time already looking for secrets in men like you, following my daughter in her search to get rid of me...but still, I have found, and eliminated, an alarming number of people who DO know things, knew things about me that even &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; didn&amp;#39;t know. YOU are not one of them. You&amp;#39;re not worth the seconds it would take to kill, not when I wasted so many already...”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
All I could do was watch through the crack in the open vault door as Cass ran through the widow of my 5th floor office window and  hear her splash in a soft, silent pillow on top of the concrete pavement below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;
                                            [selftext] => &amp;nbsp;
Women come into this bank-turned-office crying all the time. But the one crying in front of me now wasn't par for the course. I sensed that this woman's spirit was like the Titanic, once massive and proud, now broken, sunk, lying in the dark. She wiped her eyes and sniffled for minutes before whispering:

&amp;nbsp; 
“Mister Moxley...I have a lot of hope in you. I heard that you used to work for the  military....or government, like the X-files or SPC or something like that...” I penciled in a legal pad and turned the pad to her. The note said: “something.” What I said aloud was “No”. The lady read my note and nodded before continuing. 

&amp;nbsp; 
“....I also heard you know how to make people who...are...well, who are MORE than human...go away. For good.” I wrote on the next page of my pad. The note said “who do you want to make disappear?” as I said “You are mistaken" loudly enough to satisfy any recorded testimony.

&amp;nbsp;
When the lady was done reading my note, I stood and kicked my head back towards the bank vault door behind the mahogany desk and spun the wheel, opening the vault. The women stepped in. As soon as the vault door was latched and spun in place, I knew that nobody could spy on us. *Almost* nobody.

&amp;nbsp;
When we were both standing in the vault, I asked her who was leaving us. When she answered “my mother”, I asked why, naturally. 

&amp;nbsp;
“Because saying “monster” doesn't cover it. She isolated me my entire life. Not only was I home schooled, but she always kept me five miles south of the middle of nowhere since I was a baby. When we went out to the town, she was always by my side. She even goes into the bathroom with me when we are away from home. She has total control over what I eat, how I exercise, when I sleep and who I should love. And when I *DID* fall in love with a man I met, she told me if I ever got pregnant, she would murder us all. That was...years ago. She forbids me to leave the house to live on my own, saying that if I do...she'll kill me. I always believed her, I saw her kill 2 people by the time I was 30. I tried to get away, I tried to go to the cops and others for help, but that never, ever worked. I swear it's the will of my mother, she's the smartest, most observant person on the planet, and I believe she can do more than any one human...and after what I learned today... something has to change. So I demanded answers, today. And...I got them.”

&amp;nbsp;
The 45 year old lady that walked into my office said her name was Kai...with a name like that, I didn't doubt that she was home-schooled. But she was articulate. Sharply aware eyed that twinkled with intelligence despite the fatigue and stress. Tall, muscular and beautiful. Smelled like strawberry flowers and fresh laundry. It was a shame to see this beautiful lady so distraught, but I managed to calm her nerves to the point where they were loose enough to let go of her lips to say:

&amp;nbsp; 
“My mother, Cassidy, Cass- she brought me into her bedroom to talk to me about “life” last night. I told her I already knew about biology.

They howled and barked until I thought I was going to lose my mind from sleep deprivation. I’d finally drift off and then another round of back-and-forth barking would jar me wide awake again. It’s the definition of torture. I’m normally a huge animal lover but honestly, I was so angry about 3 AM that I wanted to blown them away with a shotgun. Instead of blatant animal abuse, I decided to raise my window and shout for them to shut up. While more lawful and civil than taking matters in my own hands, It was a futile endeavor. If anything, yelling at them just triggered the damn mutts to bark even more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally I closed the curtains and gave up. Whatever it was that kept them on higher alert was apparently a ‘big deal’. They were going nuts! No ordinary thing would’ve agitated them so much but I wasn’t about to go outside to investigate. Whatever it was, they were on their own. I didn’t have any desire to get shot by another agitated neighbor trying to quiet ‘the canine quartet’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a miracle I didn’t fall asleep at work the next morning. A person may be able to adjust to half of their normal amount of sleep time; but not if it’s just frequently interrupted, shallow ‘catnaps’. I was a wreck but with the aid of copious amounts of caffeine and an uncomfortable office chair, I managed to chase away my drowsy periods. When I got home, I caught my second wind and assumed I would just go to bed at my normal time. It seemed that my body had other ideas. I sat down on my bed to take off my shoes and the next thing I knew, it was almost 4 AM. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dogs were barking their heads off again but I wasn’t as angry about it this time. I’d already received my seven hours of sleep. They could bark and growl all they wanted at the object of their scorn. It wasn’t my problem anymore but I was still curious what was drawing their ire. Was it a rogue bear or deer that had wandered out of the woods and into our neighborhood? I knew a raccoon or possum would never receive that level of condemnation from the ‘neighbor-hound watch team’. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I yanked open my curtains and tried to see what all the infernal ruckus was about. For the longest time, I couldn’t see anything from my upstairs vantage point (not even the damned mutts themselves); but as my eyes adjusted to the darkness, I could see the general direction they were fixated on. The whole skirmish was taking place in my front yard! I’ve learned that there are certain degrees of agitation which they experience. They bark, growl, or howl; all depending upon the severity of circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A half dozen of my neighbor’s wandering dogs were in ‘full attack mode’ over something which clearly set them off. They began to snarl at something like a large pack of arctic wolves. I’d never seen anything like their bewildering behavior. It was surreal! No matter what the breed, I guess they are never really that far from their distant cousins. Naturally, the intensity of their invisible focus elevated my heart rate. What the hell where they seeing? All of them possessed the body language and erect posture of a wild mongrel about to spring on a fierce enemy. Whatever it was, it terrified them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end as they surrounded an unseen threat. I was creeped out because I couldn’t view what they obviously could. All I saw were the autumn leaves in the yard cracking under it’s invisible weight. The dogs bared their fangs and gnashed their teeth in a primal fury. To my horror, they slowly herded their unseen adversary against the side of my house like their wolf cousins would. It was a brilliant strategic maneuver. Whatever ‘it’ was, the thing was literally backed up against a wall. I expected a full-on assault from the pack at any second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In moments of ‘pack bravery’, they would take turns lunging and nipping at the cornered creature; followed by squeals of pain and instant recoil. Obviously the beast fought back with enough ferocity to injure and keep the dogs at bay. Suddenly, their mutual, unbroken gaze followed it upward. To my dismay, all canine eyes were now focused on me in the window! The unseen creature must have spotted me observing the ugly fracas and was trying to get away from it’s determined attackers. I heard the long cedar planks of my sideboards creak from an invisible burden placed upon them. I could hear it slowly creep up the side of the house toward my defenseless window. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mutts were almost rabid now. Snarling, growling, barking with an intensity I didn’t think was possible for domestic animals. They were leaping up on the side of the house in futility; trying to get one last bite in before the thing was completely out of reach. Perhaps they were angry that it could scale up the side of the wall and escape from them. In less than five seconds it was right outside the window! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still couldn’t see anything through the glass but I could distinguish a large distortion in my view of the outside world! I guess it was only visible in a light range spectrum the dogs could see. The creature clung to the outside of my thin windowsill in obvious desperation. It scraped and pounded on the thin tempered glass, furiously trying to get in. It surely saw me there with my mouth agape, and yet it still wanted to come inside. I could only guess what unspeakable events would transpire if it was successful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt the windowsill flex and sensed that it had climbed off. I assumed it had given up and left but a moment later I heard another window on the second floor shatter. I raced to my bedroom door and locked it. The thing was inside my home and all I had to protect myself was a cheaply made interior door and vanity lock. It offered no real security. I didn’t even know for sure if it was already in my bedroom or not. The dogs continued to bark and howl outside but I barely even heard them. They couldn’t help anymore. I was on my own. Just as I tried to formulate myself an escape plan, there was a knock on the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;

I was closing up the bookstore, desperate to beat the storm being broadcast on the little TV behind the counter. Looking through the skylight, the sky was still blue, but the commute to my brother’s house was an hour long and I would be driving right into the bad weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first hint that something was off came when the clock stopped ticking. I looked up to where it sat on the wall, alarmed by the sudden interruption to a rhythm that otherwise dominated the volume of the space. My first assumption was that it had run out of power, but looking closer I saw that the second hand was still ticking without making a sound. Despite the uneasy feeling, I tried to tell myself that was normal, and flicked off the lights, letting the blue sky above light my path to the door. Then, the news broadcast stopped speaking English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or maybe they hadn’t – it still sounded like English, but it was totally garbled, as if the anchorwoman were speaking backward. I stared at the screen for a moment. Reading the closed captions, I was able to comprehend what she said, but as soon as I’d look away, it went back to gibberish. I glanced back and forth for a moment, observing this phenomenon as I began to worry I was losing my mind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite suddenly, my attention was drawn elsewhere as rain slammed against the glass storefront. I switched off the TV and checked the clock. The minute hand hadn’t moved far. Could the storm really be here already? Looking to the skylight, I caught the last glimpse of blue as it was crowded out by a menacing black cloud. My view of the street in front of the store faded to obscurity as the rain thickened. The smell of static filled the air and my skin prickled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s when I saw it. Barely visible through the rain, a figure materialized. At first, I thought it to be a person caught in the rain, but they showed no sign of urgency. As it came closer, there seemed to be a ring around the figure where rain did not fall. I was able to start making out more details of the figure, despite the rain coming down harder and harder as they approached. They were almost impossibly tall, seven or eight feet, and their skin was pale as bone. I was frozen staring at this figure for what felt like an eternity as they slowly approached the bookstore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At last, fear overtook my body and I broke away from this sight, opting to find a place to hide. Something about the figure felt absolutely sinister. I ducked behind a bookshelf and peered between the books. From this angle, I could only see directly out the front window, and not down the street. I waited, wondering whether I was scared of nothing, until the figure stepped into my view. The rain was still relentless, but I had a clear view now. As I noticed before, its skin was stark white and it stood around eight feet tall. Its skin looked dry and cracked, and the rain didn’t fall within a few feet of it. I couldn’t see the face, but it had long feathery wings that spread out of its shoulders, falling all the way down to the ground where they dragged through the muddy water. It was nude but had no genitalia, and blood leaked from where the wings sprouted, trailing behind it until the rain washed it away. Its feet were long and pointed like a reptile’s, and it dragged them as it walked. I couldn’t make out any fingers on its hands, just a scaly looking claw that hung at its side. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I held my breath as the Angel came closer to the front door. It was on a path to walk straight past, but it stopped when it was parallel to the door. My heart was racing. What was this thing doing here? Did it bring this weather? Was it hurt, should I help it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t have time to consider any of these questions. As slowly as it had approached, the Angel turned and faced the bookstore. Its abdomen was muscular, no navel or nipples, but each muscle looked like plated armor overlapping each muscle below it. It had no mouth or nose or ears, and a burned-out hole where one eye should be. The other eye had a white iris with a gash across it. It appeared to be blinded, but as it finished turning toward the store, its one eye turned to look straight at me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My blood ran cold and the smell of static grew stronger. I could feel the electricity in the air, growing more and more noticeable until I heard a loud crack behind me. I broke eye contact with the Angel to turn around in time to witness electricity leaping from the end of one metal bookshelf to a metal support beam across the room. The miniature bolt of lightning sent all the papers flying from a nearby desk, then struck again as they floated to the floor. A couple of pages caught fire, then another bolt struck from the pole to the handle of the front door, spanning the entire length of the bookstore. As these miniature bolts continued between every metal surface of the store, books started to catch fire, cornering me in my hiding place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked back out the front window, somehow hopeful the Angel would be gone, but there it stood. Now its wings were spread wide, blocking the entire view of the street, and its good eye was closed. Its arms were outstretched and seemed impossibly long. Blood poured from the tips of its wings and every part of its body seemed to breathe. With any rational thought out the window, instinct kicked in and I ran for the back door, trying to escape both the fire and the Angel. When I reached the door and grabbed the handle, electricity jolted through my arm, throwing me to the floor. At the same moment, a bolt of lightning struck the skylight, exploding the glass and flooding the store with a buildup of rain water. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The water put out the fire closest to me, but the rest of the store was still ablaze and the water wouldn’t be high enough to put it out. I grabbed for the fire extinguisher, but thought better just as another bolt struck from the pole to the extinguisher, knocking it off the wall. It rolled to my feet, so I cautiously picked it up and sprayed the nearest bookshelf. As I held the trigger I could feel the capacitance building in the extinguisher until I decided it was too dangerous to touch. Just as I threw it away from me, another bolt slammed into it in mid-air, launching it straight through the storefront. It rolled past the Angel who paid it no mind, but swiftly lowered its arms and wings. It returned to its previous position, then turned and began walking away at the same pace it had approached. As it got farther away, the rain became more and more intense, blowing around the bookstore. It helped some to put out the fire, but I had to push a couple of bookshelves into the pool forming under the skylight in order to prevent it spreading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time I had the fire completely out, the rain was dying down and blue skies were coming back. I looked up the street for the Angel, but I couldn’t even see the cloud that had surrounded it. The street was empty of anyone at all, which wasn’t actually uncommon, but didn’t put me at ease. After a while, the clock ticked again. It startled me at first, but the familiarity made me feel a bit better. When I looked up at it, it read two hours later than when it had stopped making any noise. I was sure it had only been a matter of minutes, but from the position of the sun, it was definitely a lot later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t know what to do. That night, I drove home instead of to my brother’s, eager to avoid the storm. I called him to tell him I wasn’t feeling well, and he didn’t question the tremor in my voice. I didn’t tell him about the Angel. I figured he wouldn’t believe me. I didn’t think anyone would. But it didn’t take long for me to find out that my experience was not unique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I got home, I turned on the news to see if there were any reports about odd weather. What I learned was much more strange and terrifying. The Angel I had seen was not unique. There were sightings all over the state, though no mention of them doing anything. Anyone else who saw one of these things stated that they walked in a straight line without stopping, entirely ignorant to anything around them. Some people attempted to use force to get their attention, but no one could bring themselves to harm one. They just walked straight forward, with no indication of their origin or destination. People lost track of them around the same time I had left the bookstore. Some said they disappeared into thin air, while others reported they flew off into the clouds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure what to believe. As far as I know, I’m the only one who saw my Angel, and the news didn’t say anything about them spreading their wings or looking at anyone, much less causing miniature thunderstorms. I was worried nobody would believe me, but clearly something insane was going on. I decided I would tell someone tomorrow and show them the extensive damage to my bookstore as a form of proof, but I didn’t know who I would tell. My brother? The police? The news? What about my insurance company? Would they cover this damage?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These questions flooded my mind as I stared at the TV, my vision slowly fading as I drifted to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

So, yes, stupidly and ignorantly, me and my fiancé were vacationing in Japan and decided to visit the Aokigahara Forest, also coined the “Suicide Forest”. We are both huge horror movie, and horror culture buffs and were in to all things even remotely creepy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the last few days of our trip, we decided to just do it. We were staying a few miles out of Tokyo, so it was a bit of a drive but we made it there eventually. It was about 3pm. We had everything we would need, plenty of water and food, even a tent if it got too dark. We had a satellite GPS to make sure we didn’t get lost. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon arriving, we saw a little office that you could go in and get a tour guide, they also warn you not to stray from the trails, and to stay out of restricted areas, for some of the terrain is not at easily navigated and it is very easy to get lost. We took a map and some brochures and started our hike. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 3 hours into the hike, we hadn’t seen anything but miles of beautiful forest. But then, out of nowhere, the sky started to get very dark, and not dark as in the sun was going down, it was only about 6pm but dark, like it was going to storm. Thick gray clouds were forming overhead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hey babe, you think we should stop? I really don’t want to get caught in this rain on the way out?” My fiancé was looking at me with a bit of concern, also stealing quick glances up at the sky. We will call him Charles for privacy reasons. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yea, we can set up our tent a little way off the path and just wait it out. Hopefully it will pass before it gets dark.” As much as I loved to be scared, being in this forest after dark still didn’t sit right with me. He nodded and started to unpack our tent. We were all set-up and laying out blankets just as the rain started pattering against the roof of the tent. “It’s already getting cold.” I commented, as the rain began to pick up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 4 hours had passed, I was exhausted and the rain still had not let up; better yet, it had gotten worse. That’s when things started to get very strange. I was slowly falling asleep; Charles was reading and I had been laying with my head in his lap. A loud crash made me sit up straight, knocking his book from his grasp. He looked at me with concern. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Did a tree just fall?” I asked, staring back with the same look of concern. That’s the only logical explanation that I could come up with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know?” He pulled the zipper down and shined our flashlight outside. The rain was still pouring down. “There’s nothing out there that can see.” He zipped the opening shut so water wouldn’t keep pouring in. It stayed quiet for only a few seconds before we heard two more loud crashes, even louder than the first. Like boulders crashing to the floor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Should we leave? I don’t like being stuck out here all night.” He was sitting closer to me now. I think he was just as scared as I was, just didn’t want me to know. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think it would be a good idea to try and leave at night. We could get lost. We should just try and sleep. I knew he was right, but I also knew that I wasn’t going to be able to sleep. I laid in the tent for about an hour, and must have fallen asleep because next thing I knew, I was being shaken awake. I opened my eyes startled and stared up into the eyes of my fiancé. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What are you doing? What is going on?” he pressed his finger to his lips, making the “shh” motion. I looked around the tent frantically.  He leaned forward and whispered &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Someone is outside the tent.” Those words sent chills down my spine that I can still feel to this day. The rain had slowed down to a soft patter at this point. I could hear voices but couldn’t understand anything they were saying. It took me a few minutes to realize they were speaking Japanese.  I looked back up at Charles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Maybe they are just hikers, or park patrol making sure that we are ok?” I whispered up at him. He frowned but decided to see if I was right. He got up and unzipped the tent. He walked out with out flashlight, it was still pitch black out which was weird because if my watch was right is was almost 8am. I must have slept a lot longer than I thought. “Babe, what’s going on?” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There’s no one out here?” When I peeked my head out, he was about 50 yards away walking through the trees. The rain was freezing when it hit my skin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What do you mean no one out here?” I tripped out of the tent and dropped my flashlight. The light went out briefly but slowly flickered back on. I wiped the dirt off my knees and went to stand back up. “I know for a fact I heard voices there can’t be no-” He was gone. “Charles?” I yelled shining my flashlight through the trees. I could no longer see the beam from his light. “CHARLES!” I screamed his name with a bit of desperation and started walking in the direction that I last saw his light. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to panic. It had been twenty minutes now, of my yelling his name and wandering through the trees. I could barely even see the light from our tent any more. At this point I had tears streaming down my face. That’s when I heard the sobbing. I swung my flashlight in the direction of the sound. There was Charles, huddled at the base of a large tree. His shirt was torn and he was sobbing. I ran to him but when I got close he started screaming at me. But he wasn’t speaking English…..I think he was speaking Japanese… which was impossible, neither of us knew Japanese… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His face looked strange, it was all distorted. His eyes were squinted and even though he was sobbing he was smiling this eerie smile, and his eyes followed my every move. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Charles what happened?” no response. “Charles! What is wrong with you…what happened. We need to get back to the tent.” I tried to take his arm but he pulled away. After a few attempts he followed me back to the tent, never saying a word. Honestly, he didn’t say much of anything, til we were all the was back in California, where I’m writing this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He seems normal during the days; he doesn’t remember what happened. He never wants to talk about it either. But that isn’t even what I’m worried about. It’s the nights. He isn’t him at night. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, it wasn’t that bad I would wake up some nights and he was standing at the foot of our bed, motionless just watching me sleep. He will eventually go back to bed on his own; I tried waking him once and he was hysterical. He wouldn’t stop screaming. I would also wake up to him mumbling Japanese, which I still could not explain. Maybe he picked some up when we were there. He would usually stop and go back to sleep. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently it’s been much worse, I wrote out everything that happened in order so it would be easier to understand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday night: I woke up to slow scratching sounds coming from the ceiling. When I turned on the light to see what it was I heard something crash to the floor. Charles was lying motionless on his back on the bedroom floor. Above him on the ceiling were claw marks, scratched deeply into the ceiling. There is no way he did those himself, but I have no other explanation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday night: I woke up, freezing cold. Upon inspecting the room and walking through the house, every single door, cabinet, window and drawer was open in the house. Including the front and back door, and the garage. Charles was fast asleep in bed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday night: I awoke as usual around 8am. Charles was not in bed. There were dark footprints all over our bedroom floor, but they never left the room. Nowhere could I find where the person entered or exited the room, it looks like they just paced back and forth around the bed. I later found Charles outside in our shed, covered in dirt, with no memory of how he got there or why he was outside. His clothes were torn just like they were when I found him that night in Aokigahara. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday night: Relatively uneventful, Charles woke up screaming for help, in English this time. When I looked at him it was like for the first time in a long time I was looking into the eyes on my fiancé, but that was short lived. He almost immediately fell back asleep, and woke up with no memory of what happened. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday night was the worst. I woke up because there was something scratching my neck. I tried to brush it off but I realized it was caught. I quickly realized it was a poorly handmade noose. I screamed and took it off my neck. I reached for Charles but he wasn’t in bed. I walked the house looking for him. There were nooses hung haphazardly all over my house. All were made from the same thick red rope. Charles was standing in front of one in the middle of my kitchen. Sobbing and mumbling in Japanese. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday night: Charles was sobbing in bed; he had scratched his neck completely raw; it was bleeding in some places and bruised. He wouldn’t stop scratching until I physically secured his hands. He woke up, told me he must have had some type of allergic reaction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what to do. Charles writes them off as me just having vivid nightmares, and says he probably just sleep walks but I know something is wrong. I think something came back with us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;

I screamed and took it off my neck. I reached for Charles but he wasn’t in bed. I walked the house looking for him. There were nooses hung haphazardly all over my house. All were made from the same thick red rope. Charles was standing in front of one in the middle of my kitchen. Sobbing and mumbling in Japanese. 

Saturday night: Charles was sobbing in bed; he had scratched his neck completely raw; it was bleeding in some places and bruised. He wouldn’t stop scratching until I physically secured his hands. He woke up, told me he must have had some type of allergic reaction. 


I don’t know what to do. Charles writes them off as me just having vivid nightmares, and says he probably just sleep walks but I know something is wrong. I think something came back with us.

It had been a long day and I had not caught any fish so my enthusiasm for fishing was waning. Instead I began to aimlessly watch the clear ocean water, watching all the waves and currents. Suddenly, I saw a small plastic zip lock bag filled with an air bubble floating very close to the surface. My curiosity ignited I asked my uncle to steer the boat to the object. Once we were close enough I grabbed the plastic zip lock bag with the fishing net and brought it on board. To my surprise the plastic zip lock bag was not empty, but contained a small SanDisk USB flash drive. There were also remnants of a paper message, but it was unreadable do to some seawater leakage in the ziplock bag. The USB drive being 16 GB I decided to keep it. Who knows when something like this could come to use in college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About two weeks ago the college semester resumed and I brought the USB drive to college with me, and although I noticed some other files on the USB drive I just ignored them for the time being because of how busy I was with college. I had all my CAD files, videos, and music on the USB drive, and the USB drive was serving me well. Until last night that is. Last night after I had finished all my music I was downloading a Concert mp4 video to my USB drive until I got the classic windows error message something along the lines of, “There is not enough space on this drive for this copy to complete”. I swore to myself knowing that this would inevitably happen, with how much data I had already put on the USB drive. “Ok no problem I will just delete these old files I found on the USB drive when I found it” I thought. My curiosity was then aroused, and I decided to be have a look at the files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first folder had the name of “Daesh” Inside this folder there were two more folders, one with the name of “Daesh, Stade de France Saint-Denis Paris (2015)” and the other with the name of “Daesh,1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW Washington, D.C. (2018)”. I first clicked on the 2015 folder and it brought of a password lock. “Dammit”,I though, and I clicked on the 2018 folder. Inside this folder there were 2 files, one of them was called “Daesh Info”, and it was password protected as well. The other file was a simple text file that I could open without providing a password. I opened this file, and I have copied the text from the file put it through a translator, and pasted it below. The text seems to be the copied conversation between two people on various dates. I am not sure what they are talking about fully, but reading the conversation send shivers down my spine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;January 1 2017&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daesh2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/ It will work I guarantee it, just like how I guaranteed the Paris project would work&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daesh1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/ This project is on a whole new scale, but the Paris project was a great success&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daesh2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/ I agree it was perfect due to your men. They performed the job perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daesh1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/ More than perfectly, 130 dead hundreds injured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;January 2 2017&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daesh1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/ I will only provide the men if I receive the shipments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daesh2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/ I will provide all you need, I will just need the men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daesh2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/ They must be highly trained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daesh1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/ Has the quality of my soldiers ever disappointed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daesh2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/ I have never been disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;January 21 2017&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daesh2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/ We must decide on a date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daesh1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/ 2018 is when my soldiers will be ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daesh2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/ I know this project will work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daesh1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/ If we prevail we will kill two birds with one stone as the american people will say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daesh1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/ I have confidence, but this project is bigger than any project we have ever attempted.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daesh2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/ Not only larger than any project our organization have ever attempted, but larger than every Project ever attempted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daesh1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/ Larger even than the 2001 project?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daesh2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/ Yes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#39;s the whole conversation I don’t know if I should just delete the conversation from the USB drive, or if I should give the USB drive to the police, so they can handle this situation more professionally. Although I am loathing to give up my USB drive though because of all the important school files I have stored on it.&lt;/p&gt;

So that's the whole conversation I don’t know if I should just delete the conversation from the USB drive, or if I should give the USB drive to the police, so they can handle this situation more professionally. Although I am loathing to give up my USB drive though because of all the important school files I have stored on it.

Situated at the intersection of the Cumberland and Allegheny Mountains and the Cumberland Plateau, it stands at the center of a depression in the terrain entirely uncharacteristic of the surrounding area. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having recently acquired a permit from the state for a fracking exploration, the petroleum company that hired us was anxious to see what they could exploit in this new area. We were to set out as soon as possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We began our hike on a Monday morning. The weather was predicted to be favorable and the four of us were excited to cover some ground. We stopped at a small store near the edge of the forest to purchase last-minute supplies and anything else we thought we might need. It wasn’t a particularly difficult journey ahead of us, but we wanted to be prepared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we were browsing, an employee began a conversation with Jake Lemont, one of our geologists. Jake was forthcoming, as we were under no obligation to keep our work secret. I walked the aisles and drifted in and out of their conversation, which grew noticeably more animated as time went by. The employee was not keen on the mountain being used for petroleum exploration. It turned out he wasn’t speaking from an environmental standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1940s and 1950s, multiple coal companies had attempted to mine the area around Fallenfield Mountain. Each attempt had resulted in the deaths of local miners. Due to the hideous regulatory framework surrounding the mining industry in the mid-20th century, little was done about it. The companies just shut down the mines and moved elsewhere. According to the employee, who had lost his father in one of those accidents, we were setting ourselves up for another disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undeterred, we began our trek at 10am. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As expected, the first day’s hike was pleasant. Gorgeous weather and lovely scenery kept our spirits high. Around 6:30pm, we set up camp for the night. Raphael built a fire while Jake and Matteo went fishing in the nearby river. An hour later, they came back with a couple beautiful fish. They scaled and cleaned them and before I knew it, we were enjoying a spectacular meal in the woods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had two tents and I shared mine with Raphael. We got to sleep shortly after 9pm. Around 2am, we were awakened by a strange, droning sound far in the distance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There’s a military base about a hundred miles from here,” Raph told me. “It sounds like they’re doing engine testing or something.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I nodded and forgot about it. I slept like a log for the rest of the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We broke down the tents and were all packed up by 7:30 the next morning. We ate on the go. The walk grew more difficult as the terrain became rugged. We were in the mountains now. They weren’t sheer, towering slabs of rock, but they still took time to hike up and over or, in most cases, go around. We were decked out with climbing equipment for when we needed to climb, and once we reached Fallenfield we knew we would have to, but we wanted to keep it to a minimum. Despite us all being trained climbers, we didn’t feel like we needed to take any unnecessary risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toward the middle of the day, we heard the droning sound again. It was louder now and birds took to the air, squawking in protest. The four of us looked around, trying to get an idea of where it could be coming from. Raph reiterated his explanation to Matteo and Jake about the military base, but he seemed more uncertain this time. We’d been walking in the opposite direction of the base all day. The sound should have been getting quieter. It wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pushed ahead, interrupted frequently by the drone and the subsequent stopping and speculating by the four of us about what it could be. Jake even used the sat phone to call up the company and ask if there was any industries or stations in the area that we didn’t know about. In fact, there were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The abandoned remains of three coal mining operations stood on the edge of the basin surrounding Fallenfield Mountain. None of them had been in use since the late 1950s and had long succumbed to the wilderness. In the 1990s, the state had sent crews to the sites to seal up the more dangerous aspects of the facilities like the mine shafts, the furnaces, and whatnot, but from what our company would tell us, their multiple flyover surveys showed no activity around there whatsoever. If the sound was coming from those abandoned sites, they had no idea why. This information did little to put us at ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of the day when we were setting up camp, I realized it’d been hours since we’d heard the droning. I felt good about that, and the feeling lasted about three hours. That was when it started to rain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jake called the company and we got bad news: it looked like there was a cold front that had reached us sooner than expected. The next 48 hours were going to be a washout. We were encouraged to continue walking, but we were cautioned to take our time and be careful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rain pelted our tents all night and soaked us from head to toe the next day. Rivers swelled and ran over their banks, dirt became clingy mud, and visibility went down to only a few feet. Still, onward we trudged. There was no hint of the droning noise at all that day, and after a while it had been 24 hours since we’d last heard it. All we heard was the rain, wind, and the cascade of profanity from our group as we tried to push forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mid afternoon, the rain intensified. We gave up trying to walk and set up camp. Everything was muddy. Everything was wet. Everyone was cold. We huddled together and shared a bottle of whiskey Matteo had brought, which helped a little. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it was dark, Jake and Matteo decided to call it a night and went to their own tent. Raph zipped himself in his sleeping bag and was snoring within three minutes. Eventually I fell asleep and was met by frequent, vivid nightmares. The drone permeated my dreams and carried unintelligible whispers within it. I felt like I was being pulled through the forest toward those abandoned mining facilities and the mountain behind them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point after dawn, after Raph had left the tent to presumably take a leak, he rushed back a declared, “Matt and Jake are gone.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still bleary eyed from the atrocious night of sleep I’d gotten, I croaked out, “what?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Matteo. Jake. They’re gone. Their tent is a wreck and they left a trail of their stuff going out into the woods.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Raph had my full attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What are you talking about?,” I asked, knowing exactly what he was talking about but still unable to comprehend why they would’ve done something like that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Let’s go,” Raphael said, and started packing up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I extricated myself from the sleeping bag and got dressed. Raph pulled the tent down after me. Within ten minutes, we were following the trail of food and sleeping bags and clothes through the sopping forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Did you call Becky and Hansen to let them know what happened?,” I asked Raph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He shook his head. “Jake has the sat phone.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We traveled in silence for well over an hour. Neither of us had experience tracking anything through the woods, let alone in the driving rain. Still, Jake and Matteo had left a trail of belongings that made it easy enough. We found the sat phone, waterlogged and destroyed, in a puddle next to a tree. We found their shirts soon after. And their pants. And shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eight hours later, I looked at my watch. 3pm. The rain pummeled us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“How far do you figure we are from those mining facilities,?” I asked Raph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hard to tell. We’re probably a few hours away, then another hour or two from Fallenfield.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, three hours later, as the light in the forest washed away, we stood in front of a large, dilapidated industrial building. One of the mining facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raph noticed one of the windows on the ground floor was broken, and he suggested we go inside and set up camp for the night. I stared at the rusty, metal facade of the old building. I didn’t like the looks of it. Not at all. Still, with daylight ticking away and the constant, god damned rain, I knew it was what we had to do. We climbed in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was dark inside. Not pitch black, but hazy gray. The windows were covered in grime and let in little of the remaining daylight. Shadowy silhouettes of decaying mining equipment loomed around us - ore extractors, conveyor belts, furnaces, and a whole bunch of things I couldn’t recognize. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The air was still. The rain on the metal ceiling sounded like gunshots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t see a sign of them in here,” Raph observed. “I was hoping they would’ve come to take shelter on the way to wherever they were headed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t answer. My eyes were acclimating to the dimness. I studied the massive room for a minute or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What do you think?” asked Raph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think we’ll get anywhere tonight in this rain,” I told him. Raph nodded. He began laying out our sodden sleeping bags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first couple hours, I didn’t sleep. I gazed at the ceiling and let my mind wander to terrible places where Matteo and Jake were dead or dying in a flooded ravine, screaming for help. I imagined them caught under rocks after a landslide, bodies broken and covered with mud, waiting for wolves or bears to finish them off. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the rain tapered off at 3am, I slept. Again, I felt as if I were being pulled toward Fallenfield Mountain. The pull was soft and seductive, like a lover guiding me by hand into the bedroom. More droning came through my slumber - not bellowing, but still insistent, like heavy breath in my ears. I thought heard more whispers in that breath. The voices sounded like Matteo and Jake. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Raph. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was as if they were inviting me to come get them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I woke up at 6:15, Raph wasn’t next to me. His clothes lay crumpled on his sleeping bag. Across the room, the far window was broken. When I went over to investigate, I saw fresh blood on the glass. I knew whose it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized that all the objectives of my original job had to be put on the back burner. I needed to do a number of things: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first was to find my colleagues. I didn’t know what had happened, but there was no way I’d leave them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, and I surprised myself by how far away this second priority was, I had to get myself out of there safely -- if only to warn the company not to send others out here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, if this could even be considered a possibility, if everything turned out to be a bizarre case of happenstance, the four of us could continue the survey. But that might as well have been a joke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gathered the minimal supplies I had remaining and set off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right outside the property of the mining facility was the descent into Fallenfied Basin. It wasn’t particularly steep, but it went a long way down through mud and pulverized shards of rock. I guess the best way to describe Fallenfield Mountain is that it’s like a castle surrounded by a moat. Luckily for me, there wasn’t much water I’d have to slog through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was some, though, and it was doubtless more than usual thanks to the rain we’d had to deal with. As I trudged ahead, I was greeted by that same droning sound, louder than ever. There were no whispers, though. For that, I was thankful. I could attribute the droning to the military base, despite it being nowhere near me anymore. The whispers, though -- those were the stuff of nightmares. I didn’t know what I’d do if I heard those while wide awake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took three hours to get to the bottom of Fallenfield Basin. I’d been forced to change paths multiple times due to flooding and mud that threatened to bury me to my chin. A few times, I saw depressions in the mud that could have been the footprints of my colleagues. They didn’t lead anywhere, though -- just to more water or mud. For all I knew, I could have passed them without noticing hours ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn’t matter. I knew, if they’d survived, they would have gone toward the mountain. My memories how I felt when I slept made me certain they’d experienced the same sensation of being pulled. Except, in their cases, it seemed like it had been more than just a sensation. It had been a compulsion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometime around 10:00, I reached the base of Fallenfield Mountain. I studied its heavily-forested side, grateful I wouldn’t have to be climbing up sheer rock-faces until much later in the ascent. The wooded climb, while steep, wasn’t very difficult. Even my unclothed, supply-lacking colleagues could have done it. Why they would have, however, eluded me. And terrified me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two hours were spent climbing up the wooded mountainside. The trees grew sparse after that. Sheets of rock replaced forest soil. I starting using my climbing axe. I thought to myself there was no way the three guys could have gotten this far. They simply weren’t equipped to handle the climb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A half hour later, as I maneuvered the climbing axe into a fissure in the rock face, I saw a streak of red. I looked closer. A detached finger was sticking out of the crack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A wave of nausea and vertigo rolled through me and I almost lost my balance. I took a few deep breaths. Summoning up my courage, I plucked it out. It wasn’t old. And it was definitely human. I looked up the slab I was climbing. The red streaks continued onward up the mountain. I shuddered and dropped it. A second later, the sky was split by the loudest droning sound yet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rocks shook and I hugged the wall as tightly as possible. It only lasted for a few seconds. Every part of me wanted to turn around and go back. I’d get to the bottom and walk all day and all night, however long it took, to get me back into town. “Forget those guys,” I kept telling myself. “They’re the ones who left you, not the other way around.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those were the thoughts that echoed through my consciousness as I climbed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was on autopilot from that point forward. My mind shouted “go back!” while my body pulled itself up Fallenfield Mountain. Now I understood how the others had been compelled. Up and up and up and up I went. My body was baking in the sunlight. It was so unbearably hot. Hotter than it should have been. Hotter than it &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have been. I found myself shucking off articles of clothing every chance I got. It could have been my imagination, but I would have sworn I saw steam coming from cracks and crevices in the rock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a point when I knew I had to be near the peak. Fallenfield Mountain is a little more than four thousand feet high. When I looked over my shoulder, I knew I had to be close. I hauled myself onto the edge of an indentation in the rock and realized, after a moment spent catching my breath and trying to regain a semblance of self control, how deep the indentation really was. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d reached the mouth of a cave. From floor to ceiling, it was probably fifty feet high. It didn’t go back particularly far; I could see the rear of it maybe a hundred yards back. I got up and walked forward. I was wearing nothing but my shoes and underwear and still I felt like I was boiling in my skin. Another drone shook the mountain. That time, I was sure I saw steam oozing from the fissures in the rock. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I smelled it, too. It was like charred, rotting meat. I saw things stuffed inside the cracks. Dead animals, mostly birds and squirrels in various stages of decomposition. My brain fired its “run away!” messages over and over and over but my body simply ignored them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the distance, dim against the rock at the rear of the cave, I saw three shapes. I walked toward them. Before I could make out what they were, I knew who they were. A few seconds later, I was standing in front of the bodies of Raphael, Jake, and Matteo. Their fingers were worn down to bloody nubs. Their toes were almost all gone. Even their teeth were missing and their gums were frayed all the way to their jaw bones. I felt profoundly ill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another drone. This time, it felt deeper and more resonant. Before my eyes, a chasm opened in the rock below my three colleagues. They dropped inside, maybe two feet. Steam erupted from below and the odor of charring flesh filled the cave. I backed up and clutched the wall to my left, just for a second, when I felt the rock move against my back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I whirled around, surprised I had that much control over my body. It was as if whatever had been compelling me had brought me to that one spot and released its hold. I stared at the spot that had moved. Eight, shiny black ovals dotted the surface of the granite wall, each about two feet high and a foot and a half wide. They were featureless. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The steam from the corpses of my colleagues had gotten thick and choking. It was hard to see what had happened on the wall. I got closer to one of the ovals, my face only inches away, when it moved. The shiny blackness slid apart on either side. A colossal, gazing eye stared back at me. In my peripheral vision, I could see that the seven others had done the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I screamed and struck one with my axe. Thick, yellow fluid squirted out onto the floor. The droning sound exploded from all around and the mountain shook as if an earthquake were tearing it apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took off running toward the mouth of the cave. I could see, all along the walls, more and more of the eyes were opening. Their vile pupils followed my movement. I struck a few more with my axe as I ran, trying not to fall as the shaking threatened to hurl me to the ground. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a panic, I looked over my shoulder at the rear of the cave. The entire back portion had fallen away, revealing a cluster of more eyes, fifty feet high thirty wide. They glared as I ran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around me, more rock faces started to change. Not just eyes, this time. Limbs. They twitched and writhed and seethed and enveloped; how things so large could move with such serpentine agility confounded me, but the confusion only came long after the fact. In the moment, terror was all I felt. Detached, otherworldly terror. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reached the ledge that had brought me to the cave, fully expecting I would jump off and fall and leave my fate to chance. The mountain had changed, however. It was sinking into the ground. The sheer faces I’d climbed were now like leathery, pocketed flesh. And they were at an angle I could run on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My imagination whirled even as I ran. I imagined impossible things chasing me. I imagined the ground lurching and heaving with hideous breath and grasping limbs; things that couldn’t actually be happening, but in my stark horror, I knew they were real. The mountain bellowed what sounded like words and phrases and chants and I felt my eardrums crackling and fraying. My feet pounded the porous ground as I ran away, hearing over the noise the slithering and hissing fronds of formerly solid rock following after me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reached the forested side of the mountain and fell. I somersaulted and whirled through the air, striking the ground and trees with such force I felt bones break, but the impacts slowed me enough that the subsequent hits weren’t strong enough to kill me. I saw nothing but swirling sky and ground, but that drone, that hideous, cacophonous drone filled my head and embedded itself into my mind. The last thing I remembered was landing in the mud of Fallenfield Basin and staring into the blue, cloudless sky. My world washed away in a sea of blue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I awoke to searing, wrenching pain in my left shoulder and ankle. My eyes opened to an orange, late-afternoon sunset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I struggled in the mud, the whole event rushing back to me in a series of disjointed flashes. Writhing in the muck like a worm, I found a system of roots that allowed me to roll over and hoist myself up on my one leg that wasn’t ruined. I pulled a branch over to me and put it under my good arm and stared in disbelief at what was in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, rather, what wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fallenfield Mountain was gone. In its place was a gaping hole. Water from the basin oozed into it, falling along its edges but dropping so far I couldn’t hear it land. There were no trees. No rocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t remember how I managed to get back to town or how long it took me. All I knew was a steady, relentless stretch of pain and sleeplessness. I was found unconsciousness in a residential driveway on the outskirts of town and woke up in a hospital what turned out to be two weeks later. I returned to work a week after that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expected there to be more of a story when the public learned about the disappearance of an entire mountain. Our company did a good job keeping its actual findings quiet, though. Once they’d debriefed me and sent me back to work at the headquarters, the explanation that everyone ran with was “an earthquake caused by experimental fracking technology.” The news media loved the opportunity to take on the practices of a fossil fuel company and the public ate it out of their hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took some heavy losses and endured a public relations nightmare, but only I and the upper brass and a few researchers at the company knew the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a year later, once I’d healed up and the outrage had died down, that I believed I had the emotional fortitude to look into the actual events of those days. I pressed my higher-ups to let me see what I could find. It didn’t take much pressure. They wanted to know just as badly as I did. The last thing they needed was another “incident” like what I’d been through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat with the researchers and studied the early surveys of Fallenfield. Nothing hinted that anything organic lurked under or inside the mountain - certainly nothing that could have alluded to what it actually &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Months went by and we were at a loss. All the analyses of Fallenfield came back looking no different than any of the other mountains in the area. It was only when Ingrid, a senior researcher who’d formerly worked for the companies that had owned the old mining facilities surrounding the mountain, remembered they had conducted studies of the rocks on the outskirts of Fallenfield Mountain, in the basin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those rocks, it turned out, were of a different composition than those in the rest of the mountain range. They were rich in iron and had hallmarks of things Ingrid called “carbonaceous chondrites.” When she announced this, I noticed the jaws of some of the other researchers fall open. I wasn’t sure what she meant, so I inquired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Carbonaceous chondrites are a type of meteorite,” Ingrid said, her voice slow and thoughtful. “It means a large one hit there at some point.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me a minute, but it all came together after that. For so long, we’d wondered why Fallenfield Mountain was at the center of a depression. It didn’t make any geological sense, but we’d just chalked it up to being “one of those things.” But now, it all clicked. Fallenfield Mountain hadn’t somehow risen from the center of what we’d called Fallenfield Basin. Fallenfield Basin had been an impact crater. And the mountain had been something else &lt;a href="https://unsettlingstories.com"&gt;entirely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;
                                            [selftext] => Our company had been tasked with a geological survey of Fallenfield Mountain in southwestern Kentucky. Situated at the intersection of the Cumberland and Allegheny Mountains and the Cumberland Plateau, it stands at the center of a depression in the terrain entirely uncharacteristic of the surrounding area. 


Having recently acquired a permit from the state for a fracking exploration, the petroleum company that hired us was anxious to see what they could exploit in this new area. We were to set out as soon as possible. 


We began our hike on a Monday morning. The weather was predicted to be favorable and the four of us were excited to cover some ground. We stopped at a small store near the edge of the forest to purchase last-minute supplies and anything else we thought we might need. It wasn’t a particularly difficult journey ahead of us, but we wanted to be prepared.


While we were browsing, an employee began a conversation with Jake Lemont, one of our geologists. Jake was forthcoming, as we were under no obligation to keep our work secret. I walked the aisles and drifted in and out of their conversation, which grew noticeably more animated as time went by. The employee was not keen on the mountain being used for petroleum exploration. It turned out he wasn’t speaking from an environmental standpoint.


In the 1940s and 1950s, multiple coal companies had attempted to mine the area around Fallenfield Mountain. Each attempt had resulted in the deaths of local miners. Due to the hideous regulatory framework surrounding the mining industry in the mid-20th century, little was done about it. The companies just shut down the mines and moved elsewhere. According to the employee, who had lost his father in one of those accidents, we were setting ourselves up for another disaster.


Undeterred, we began our trek at 10am. 


As expected, the first day’s hike was pleasant. Gorgeous weather and lovely scenery kept our spirits high. Around 6:30pm, we set up camp for the night. Raphael built a fire while Jake and Matteo went fishing in the nearby river. An hour later, they came back with a couple beautiful fish. They scaled and cleaned them and before I knew it, we were enjoying a spectacular meal in the woods.


We had two tents and I shared mine with Raphael. We got to sleep shortly after 9pm. Around 2am, we were awakened by a strange, droning sound far in the distance. 


“There’s a military base about a hundred miles from here,” Raph told me. “It sounds like they’re doing engine testing or something.”


I nodded and forgot about it. I slept like a log for the rest of the night.


We broke down the tents and were all packed up by 7:30 the next morning. We ate on the go. The walk grew more difficult as the terrain became rugged. We were in the mountains now. They weren’t sheer, towering slabs of rock, but they still took time to hike up and over or, in most cases, go around. We were decked out with climbing equipment for when we needed to climb, and once we reached Fallenfield we knew we would have to, but we wanted to keep it to a minimum. Despite us all being trained climbers, we didn’t feel like we needed to take any unnecessary risks.


Toward the middle of the day, we heard the droning sound again. It was louder now and birds took to the air, squawking in protest. The four of us looked around, trying to get an idea of where it could be coming from. Raph reiterated his explanation to Matteo and Jake about the military base, but he seemed more uncertain this time. We’d been walking in the opposite direction of the base all day. The sound should have been getting quieter. It wasn’t.


We pushed ahead, interrupted frequently by the drone and the subsequent stopping and speculating by the four of us about what it could be. Jake even used the sat phone to call up the company and ask if there was any industries or stations in the area that we didn’t know about. In fact, there were.


The abandoned remains of three coal mining operations stood on the edge of the basin surrounding Fallenfield Mountain. None of them had been in use since the late 1950s and had long succumbed to the wilderness. In the 1990s, the state had sent crews to the sites to seal up the more dangerous aspects of the facilities like the mine shafts, the furnaces, and whatnot, but from what our company would tell us, their multiple flyover surveys showed no activity around there whatsoever. If the sound was coming from those abandoned sites, they had no idea why. This information did little to put us at ease.


Toward the end of the day when we were setting up camp, I realized it’d been hours since we’d heard the droning. I felt good about that, and the feeling lasted about three hours. That was when it started to rain.


Jake called the company and we got bad news: it looked like there was a cold front that had reached us sooner than expected. The next 48 hours were going to be a washout. We were encouraged to continue walking, but we were cautioned to take our time and be careful. 


The rain pelted our tents all night and soaked us from head to toe the next day. Rivers swelled and ran over their banks, dirt became clingy mud, and visibility went down to only a few feet. Still, onward we trudged. There was no hint of the droning noise at all that day, and after a while it had been 24 hours since we’d last heard it. All we heard was the rain, wind, and the cascade of profanity from our group as we tried to push forward.


Mid afternoon, the rain intensified. We gave up trying to walk and set up camp. Everything was muddy. Everything was wet. Everyone was cold. We huddled together and shared a bottle of whiskey Matteo had brought, which helped a little. 


When it was dark, Jake and Matteo decided to call it a night and went to their own tent. Raph zipped himself in his sleeping bag and was snoring within three minutes. Eventually I fell asleep and was met by frequent, vivid nightmares. The drone permeated my dreams and carried unintelligible whispers within it. I felt like I was being pulled through the forest toward those abandoned mining facilities and the mountain behind them. 


At some point after dawn, after Raph had left the tent to presumably take a leak, he rushed back a declared, “Matt and Jake are gone.”


Still bleary eyed from the atrocious night of sleep I’d gotten, I croaked out, “what?”


“Matteo. Jake. They’re gone. Their tent is a wreck and they left a trail of their stuff going out into the woods.”


Now Raph had my full attention.


“What are you talking about?,” I asked, knowing exactly what he was talking about but still unable to comprehend why they would’ve done something like that.”


“Let’s go,” Raphael said, and started packing up.


I extricated myself from the sleeping bag and got dressed. Raph pulled the tent down after me. Within ten minutes, we were following the trail of food and sleeping bags and clothes through the sopping forest.


“Did you call Becky and Hansen to let them know what happened?,” I asked Raph.


He shook his head. “Jake has the sat phone.”


We traveled in silence for well over an hour. Neither of us had experience tracking anything through the woods, let alone in the driving rain. Still, Jake and Matteo had left a trail of belongings that made it easy enough. We found the sat phone, waterlogged and destroyed, in a puddle next to a tree. We found their shirts soon after. And their pants. And shoes.


Eight hours later, I looked at my watch. 3pm. The rain pummeled us.


“How far do you figure we are from those mining facilities,?” I asked Raph.


“Hard to tell. We’re probably a few hours away, then another hour or two from Fallenfield.”


Sure enough, three hours later, as the light in the forest washed away, we stood in front of a large, dilapidated industrial building. One of the mining facilities.


Raph noticed one of the windows on the ground floor was broken, and he suggested we go inside and set up camp for the night. I stared at the rusty, metal facade of the old building. I didn’t like the looks of it. Not at all. Still, with daylight ticking away and the constant, god damned rain, I knew it was what we had to do. We climbed in.


It was dark inside. Not pitch black, but hazy gray. The windows were covered in grime and let in little of the remaining daylight. Shadowy silhouettes of decaying mining equipment loomed around us - ore extractors, conveyor belts, furnaces, and a whole bunch of things I couldn’t recognize. 


The air was still. The rain on the metal ceiling sounded like gunshots.


“I don’t see a sign of them in here,” Raph observed. “I was hoping they would’ve come to take shelter on the way to wherever they were headed.”


I didn’t answer. My eyes were acclimating to the dimness. I studied the massive room for a minute or two.


“What do you think?” asked Raph.


“I don’t think we’ll get anywhere tonight in this rain,” I told him. Raph nodded. He began laying out our sodden sleeping bags.


For the first couple hours, I didn’t sleep. I gazed at the ceiling and let my mind wander to terrible places where Matteo and Jake were dead or dying in a flooded ravine, screaming for help. I imagined them caught under rocks after a landslide, bodies broken and covered with mud, waiting for wolves or bears to finish them off. 


When the rain tapered off at 3am, I slept. Again, I felt as if I were being pulled toward Fallenfield Mountain. The pull was soft and seductive, like a lover guiding me by hand into the bedroom. More droning came through my slumber - not bellowing, but still insistent, like heavy breath in my ears. I thought heard more whispers in that breath. The voices sounded like Matteo and Jake. 


And Raph. 


It was as if they were inviting me to come get them.


When I woke up at 6:15, Raph wasn’t next to me. His clothes lay crumpled on his sleeping bag. Across the room, the far window was broken. When I went over to investigate, I saw fresh blood on the glass. I knew whose it was.


I realized that all the objectives of my original job had to be put on the back burner. I needed to do a number of things: 


The first was to find my colleagues. I didn’t know what had happened, but there was no way I’d leave them.


Second, and I surprised myself by how far away this second priority was, I had to get myself out of there safely -- if only to warn the company not to send others out here. 


Third, if this could even be considered a possibility, if everything turned out to be a bizarre case of happenstance, the four of us could continue the survey. But that might as well have been a joke.


I gathered the minimal supplies I had remaining and set off.


Right outside the property of the mining facility was the descent into Fallenfied Basin. It wasn’t particularly steep, but it went a long way down through mud and pulverized shards of rock. I guess the best way to describe Fallenfield Mountain is that it’s like a castle surrounded by a moat. Luckily for me, there wasn’t much water I’d have to slog through.


There was some, though, and it was doubtless more than usual thanks to the rain we’d had to deal with. As I trudged ahead, I was greeted by that same droning sound, louder than ever. There were no whispers, though. For that, I was thankful. I could attribute the droning to the military base, despite it being nowhere near me anymore. The whispers, though -- those were the stuff of nightmares. I didn’t know what I’d do if I heard those while wide awake.


It took three hours to get to the bottom of Fallenfield Basin. I’d been forced to change paths multiple times due to flooding and mud that threatened to bury me to my chin. A few times, I saw depressions in the mud that could have been the footprints of my colleagues. They didn’t lead anywhere, though -- just to more water or mud. For all I knew, I could have passed them without noticing hours ago.


It didn’t matter. I knew, if they’d survived, they would have gone toward the mountain. My memories how I felt when I slept made me certain they’d experienced the same sensation of being pulled. Except, in their cases, it seemed like it had been more than just a sensation. It had been a compulsion.


Sometime around 10:00, I reached the base of Fallenfield Mountain. I studied its heavily-forested side, grateful I wouldn’t have to be climbing up sheer rock-faces until much later in the ascent. The wooded climb, while steep, wasn’t very difficult. Even my unclothed, supply-lacking colleagues could have done it. Why they would have, however, eluded me. And terrified me.


Two hours were spent climbing up the wooded mountainside. The trees grew sparse after that. Sheets of rock replaced forest soil. I starting using my climbing axe. I thought to myself there was no way the three guys could have gotten this far. They simply weren’t equipped to handle the climb.


A half hour later, as I maneuvered the climbing axe into a fissure in the rock face, I saw a streak of red. I looked closer. A detached finger was sticking out of the crack.


A wave of nausea and vertigo rolled through me and I almost lost my balance. I took a few deep breaths. Summoning up my courage, I plucked it out. It wasn’t old. And it was definitely human. I looked up the slab I was climbing. The red streaks continued onward up the mountain. I shuddered and dropped it. A second later, the sky was split by the loudest droning sound yet. 


The rocks shook and I hugged the wall as tightly as possible. It only lasted for a few seconds. Every part of me wanted to turn around and go back. I’d get to the bottom and walk all day and all night, however long it took, to get me back into town. “Forget those guys,” I kept telling myself. “They’re the ones who left you, not the other way around.”


Those were the thoughts that echoed through my consciousness as I climbed. 


I was on autopilot from that point forward. My mind shouted “go back!” while my body pulled itself up Fallenfield Mountain. Now I understood how the others had been compelled. Up and up and up and up I went. My body was baking in the sunlight. It was so unbearably hot. Hotter than it should have been. Hotter than it *could* have been. I found myself shucking off articles of clothing every chance I got. It could have been my imagination, but I would have sworn I saw steam coming from cracks and crevices in the rock.


There was a point when I knew I had to be near the peak. Fallenfield Mountain is a little more than four thousand feet high. When I looked over my shoulder, I knew I had to be close. I hauled myself onto the edge of an indentation in the rock and realized, after a moment spent catching my breath and trying to regain a semblance of self control, how deep the indentation really was. 


I’d reached the mouth of a cave. From floor to ceiling, it was probably fifty feet high. It didn’t go back particularly far; I could see the rear of it maybe a hundred yards back. I got up and walked forward. I was wearing nothing but my shoes and underwear and still I felt like I was boiling in my skin. Another drone shook the mountain. That time, I was sure I saw steam oozing from the fissures in the rock. 


I smelled it, too. It was like charred, rotting meat. I saw things stuffed inside the cracks. Dead animals, mostly birds and squirrels in various stages of decomposition. My brain fired its “run away!” messages over and over and over but my body simply ignored them. 


In the distance, dim against the rock at the rear of the cave, I saw three shapes. I walked toward them. Before I could make out what they were, I knew who they were. A few seconds later, I was standing in front of the bodies of Raphael, Jake, and Matteo. Their fingers were worn down to bloody nubs. Their toes were almost all gone. Even their teeth were missing and their gums were frayed all the way to their jaw bones. I felt profoundly ill.


Another drone. This time, it felt deeper and more resonant. Before my eyes, a chasm opened in the rock below my three colleagues. They dropped inside, maybe two feet. Steam erupted from below and the odor of charring flesh filled the cave. I backed up and clutched the wall to my left, just for a second, when I felt the rock move against my back.

I screamed and struck one with my axe. Thick, yellow fluid squirted out onto the floor. The droning sound exploded from all around and the mountain shook as if an earthquake were tearing it apart.


I took off running toward the mouth of the cave. I could see, all along the walls, more and more of the eyes were opening. Their vile pupils followed my movement. I struck a few more with my axe as I ran, trying not to fall as the shaking threatened to hurl me to the ground. 


In a panic, I looked over my shoulder at the rear of the cave. The entire back portion had fallen away, revealing a cluster of more eyes, fifty feet high thirty wide. They glared as I ran.


Around me, more rock faces started to change. Not just eyes, this time. Limbs.

The sheer faces I’d climbed were now like leathery, pocketed flesh. And they were at an angle I could run on.


My imagination whirled even as I ran. I imagined impossible things chasing me.

The mountain bellowed what sounded like words and phrases and chants and I felt my eardrums crackling and fraying. My feet pounded the porous ground as I ran away, hearing over the noise the slithering and hissing fronds of formerly solid rock following after me.


I reached the forested side of the mountain and fell. I somersaulted and whirled through the air, striking the ground and trees with such force I felt bones break, but the impacts slowed me enough that the subsequent hits weren’t strong enough to kill me.

The last thing I remembered was landing in the mud of Fallenfield Basin and staring into the blue, cloudless sky. My world washed away in a sea of blue.


I awoke to searing, wrenching pain in my left shoulder and ankle. My eyes opened to an orange, late-afternoon sunset.


I struggled in the mud, the whole event rushing back to me in a series of disjointed flashes. Writhing in the muck like a worm, I found a system of roots that allowed me to roll over and hoist myself up on my one leg that wasn’t ruined. I pulled a branch over to me and put it under my good arm and stared in disbelief at what was in front of me.

&lt;p&gt;Three days ago I went for a walk up to the corner store for a pack of cigarettes. Only it was January 20th 2009 when I left. I&amp;#39;m really scared. I swear I was only gone about 25 minutes total. Only my LG phone suddenly showed no service on my phone half way home. I couldn&amp;#39;t get a signal. Not a thing. I decided to turn back and walk to the other stores across from the corner store. But it was not the way I remembered it. Suddenly stores were there that weren&amp;#39;t supposed to be there. That was baffling but I just thought that I hadn&amp;#39;t noticed them before. Luckily there was a couple new cell phone places. One of them was my provider. I walked in and asked them to take a look at my phone and asked if they could tell me why it isn&amp;#39;t getting any service. The guy opened up the back and sees if it&amp;#39;s something wrong with the battery. Nope. He consults the other guy working in the store who says to check the phone number. Then he asks for my phone number and he types it into the computer. He asks if I was such and such, not my name, I say no. He says did I fail to have my service for the last 30 days I say no I&amp;#39;ve had this phone number since 2007. He says what&amp;#39;s your name? I give him my name. He says we don&amp;#39;t have anybody on file with that name. He then punches into his system the numbers from the SIM. Well then he says &amp;quot;This phone was reported lost in 2009&amp;quot; I say &amp;quot;But it IS January 20, 2009!&amp;quot; he tells me that it is January 20, 2018 I laughed nervously and said &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re messing with me, right?&amp;quot; He says he isn&amp;#39;t, I have no words. I just leave go outside and smoke a cigarette. Figured I&amp;#39;d just go back to the house and shake this day off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I get back I try to walk in but nobody is home. No cars are around the place. See I&amp;#39;m staying with my friends because I lost my place. It&amp;#39;s a long story. Anyway the doors are locked. I wait out front smoking a cigarette but nobody comes. It must have been hours I sat there. Finally a truck stops and a guy asks if I was here to look at the place because it&amp;#39;s vacant. What? I can&amp;#39;t fathom it&amp;#39;s vacant but I was just here 20 minutes ago. What the hell...? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I go back up to the stores at the plaza to see if I can borrow someone else&amp;#39;s phone but nobody&amp;#39;s having it. I use wifi off a public open network and use my facebook to contact my mom because I couldn&amp;#39;t think of anybody else. She asks right away how I&amp;#39;m doing and where was I where had I been. I told her that All I did was walk up the street to get cigarettes and it&amp;#39;s only been about 6 hours ago. She tells me I was gone 9 years. I don&amp;#39;t know what happened. I can&amp;#39;t explain where I&amp;#39;ve been. One minute it was 12 noon January 20 2009 the next it was 2018. She sent me money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She does not believe me I know. But she sent me money to get a new phone service which I did. I just was searching in Google looking to see what I could find out about missing time and found this sub. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do I can&amp;#39;t get a hold of any of my contacts except my mom. Hers is the only number still associated with her everyone else&amp;#39;s was changed (unknown people answering) or no longer in service. And I have nowhere to go my mother is far away I guess I may have to buy a bus ticket I think I have enough money. But I don&amp;#39;t know if I can stay with my mom she&amp;#39;s disabled from a back problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t know what to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last March, my wife and I moved into our first home. A quiet suburban neighborhood in the midwest, backing up to a few hundred acres of woods. The cul-de-sac has about 10 homes, and mine is at the very top of the street. Everyone here is great, but there’s something … off with my elderly neighbor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I noticed is that she never has any lights on when she’s home. Every night the house remains pitch black. I see her looking through the window that faces our home. I swear she is looking at us every night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first attempted to speak with her a week after we moved in. I don’t know her name, so I call her Agnes. It seems fitting. Agnes was in her yard,  at the edge of her lawn near the sidewalk. Just standing still. I was walking my dog, and we made our way past Agnes’ home. My hand tensed on the leash as my dog lunged towards her. He absolutely lost his mind when he saw Agnes. My little Beagle, who loves everyone, turned into a feral beast as he snarled and snapped at her. I grabbed my dog and held him as I attempted to clam him down. Luckily, we were still a good 20 feet away from Agnes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am SO sorry.” I said. “I have no idea what got into him. He usually likes everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I waited for her response. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It never came. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to get a good look at her. She was small and thin, with snow white hair and grey eyes. Baggy blue pants and a long brown coat covered her small frame. I have since figured out that this is the ONLY outfit she wears. Every single day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spoke again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Really, I’m sorry. He doesn’t bite, but regardless I never let him off the leash. “&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still nothing. She continued to stare. After a few awkward seconds, Agnes took a few steps backward and picked up a long object that had been hiding in the tall grass of her lawn. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a shovel. She picked it up by the handle and pointed the rusty metal spade at me, and then to my dog. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“…uhh…” I didn’t know what to say. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sorry again.” And I walked away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not just my dog that does this. It’s EVERY dog that sees Agnes. Whether it is the usual neighborhood dogs, or ones from nearby subdivisions. They all go crazy, barking and lurching towards her. Agnes continues to stand there, sometimes armed with the shovel. For this, I feel badly for her. For all I know she was attacked in the past. It just amazes me that I have yet to see a dog act normally around her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second oddity happened a few months ago around 5 am. I woke up early on a Saturday Morning to start BBQ-ing. I noticed Agnes down the street. She was outside another neighbor’s house digging though their trash. Although that is strange in itself, it is not what shocked me. Whenever I see Agnes in the middle of the day, she is walking slowly, hunched over, and usually with the help of her walker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not this morning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was moving fine without it, and FAST. Really fast.  Agnes was jogging around the trash cans with agility of someone in their early 20s. What she did next truly stunned me. A neighbor had thrown out an old wooden book case. I saw Agnes bend down to grab it. 
“Please don’t hurt yourself.” I whispered to myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started walking towards her to give a helping hand. She lifted the bookcase like it was nothing. I simply don’t understand how this old woman could’ve managed it. She was most likely 90 lbs soaking wet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as she saw me walking towards her, she dropped it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sorry I didn’t mean to scare you, I was just seeing if you needed help.” I said&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She didn’t respond. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She simply looked at me, then slowly limped towards her house, as if she had lost the ability of the youthful movement I had just seen. I picked up the bookcase and walked it over to the curb. It weighed a ton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things got serious when someone broke in. I think it was Agnes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife and I returned home one night after hanging out a friend’s house. We had the dog with us as well. As the three of us waked in I could feel that something was wrong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My suspicion was verified as I entered my bedroom. 
Two human-shaped lumps were under the sheets. 
In a panic, I pulled the sheets back, and prepared to strike with the bat I held in the other hand. 
Pillows and clothes. That’s all I found. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone had placed them there in order to look like bodies. It was both terrifying and perplexing. I raced down to check the footage of my security camera. The lens faces my front door and kitchen. The only motion it recored was the quick flash of someone walking just out of the camera&amp;#39;s range. Someone wearing blue and brown. Needless to say, I changed the locks. I didn’t change them when we first moved in. She may have had a spare key from the former owner of our home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since there was no broken glass or locks, she must have come through the side door. The door that faces Agnes’ house. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This latest incident takes the take cake. Literally. Last night, I found out that my wife is pregnant. We haven’t told anyone yet, and are planning on having a big reveal for our family and friends this weekend. I opened the door this morning and noticed something on the porch. There was a cake, or what used to be cake. It was disgusting, covered in green mold with un-lit black candles stuck in the rotten icing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next to the cake was an old rag-doll with frayed red hair and black button eyes. I picked up the doll and looked over towards Agnes’ house. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was outside. Staring at me, and digging a small hole with that damn shovel. &lt;/p&gt;

They lived on a small farm in the southern United States and I would often visit them and help my Uncle on his farm. This work mostly includes feeding the livestock, and making any small repairs that a teenager could handle. I lived in a city about an hour away but my parents thought it would be good for me to get some experience on the farm. I suppose it was supposed to teach me the values of hard work I just liked it because of all the livestock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I was around fourteen of fifteen and I was going to spend a three day weekend at my Uncles farm. I hadn&amp;#39;t been to the farm since my aunt died a few years ago I would like to add that were his farm is located he has about a mile of flat land, behind that is a thick forest that stretches back for miles. This is not uncommon for people in this part of the country but what makes his farm unique is that he has a small river that runs right through the middle of his property so it isn&amp;#39;t uncommon for deer and other large animals to hang around his farm. I arrived there on Friday night after school and proceeded to eat dinner and watch an WW2 documentary with my Uncle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At around 10:30 I decided to go to bed since I had to get up at 6 to start the work on the farm. Around 10:45 I heard some weird sounds coming from the forest. Have you ever heard those videos of huskies whining, it was like that but several octaves lower. I just assumed it was a wild dog or something and went back to bed. I had intermittent sleep and heard that sound a few more times that night. I swore that one of them was on the property but I couldn&amp;#39;t be sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up the next morning and went about starting my work, a few hours into watering the plants in the personal garden I saw something that caught my eye. I could see a shape laying down near the embankment of the stream, It looked like a gray shape from a distance I couldn&amp;#39;t be sure what It was so I decided to move closer to see what it was. As I got closer I got a glimpse at what it was and I wretched. It was a human body, or at least what was left of one. They had been ripped in half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran back to the farm as fast as I could, I ran inside the house and told my Uncle everything that had happened. He looked down and told me to sit down. I stood dumbfounded, I couldn&amp;#39;t believe what I was hearing. He really wanted to talk to me when someone had just been torn apart on HIS farm. I yelled and him and called him a &amp;quot;Fucking heartless bastard&amp;quot; he just sat there. I finally sat down and told him that he better start talking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He looked down sheepishly and apologized, he said &amp;quot;I never should have let your mom convince me to let you stay here again&amp;quot;. I was confused, I noticed a strange fear that wasn&amp;#39;t there before, I looked up at him and noticed there were tears in his eyes. &amp;quot;It came to me 3 years ago, the thing said it would kill me if I didn&amp;#39;t do what it said. It told me that it was hungry- so so hungry&amp;quot;. At this moment my Uncle was holding his head in his hands, I sat there while he gained his composure. &amp;quot;It took her, it took my wife. There was nothing I could have done, I cried the rest of the night- I honestly thought she might be ok, until I heard screams from the woods. The next day I could see it standing almost as tall as the tree line, and I knew it would kill anyone who steps on his land. I thought that maybe it wouldn&amp;#39;t come for you, but I was wrong.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked out of the window to see a tall creature almost as tall as the tree line, it was brandishing a smile a little too wide for its face and was on all fours. He told me &amp;quot;You need to leave, I have let too many people die to feed this thing and I will not kill more go out the front get in my car and go&amp;quot;. I looked back at him, I didn&amp;#39;t see horror in his eyes he looked like he was ready to go. I ran out the front just in time to see the creature running towards me, I jumped in the car and drove away as fast as I could. I looked back to see the thing entering the woods accompanied by screams. I never went back to the farm, I love my uncle and I try not to think about him in his last moments. Im writing this now in the dark of my room and honestly, I&amp;#39;ll never set foot on a farm again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are completely unaware of my existence, but I am painfully aware of what you’re going through. I do not admire your current position in this surreal situation, but I wanted to help you, and your healing, the best I could. I’ve watched the news, listened to radio broadcasts’ and have heard people in the small town of Pinola, Iowa, talk about your little girl and her disappearance. It has sparked a nationwide manhunt for what the media unfairly calls me “a soulless creation of the damned”. I guess they need their “pop out at you” headlines to draw attention to their publication and news broadcasts. I assure you, I am a regular human being with a heart for child safety and their wellbeing. I want to keep children pure and untainted from this world. I know you’re gripping your cellphone all day and night, as well as having it sitting by your head in the evening. Hoping, praying, for somebody to call you saying they found Cynthia. That anticipation must be killing you. I’m sure you get around 2 hours of sleep at night. I want to tell you a bit about me before you judge me on the things I have done. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up on a farm with 4 other brothers. I was forbidden to do farm work as that was for my brother’s calloused hands. I worked in the kitchen and around the house with my mother—keeping things tidy and making sure dinner was ready when the boys came in from the field. My mother would always tell me if I slipped up once and she wasn’t able to catch it before my father, or brothers saw, I would wake up with a sore rear and a black eye. I didn’t believe her at first, I thought she was trying to use scare tactics on me so I would do the best work I could. That was until I slipped up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was making my brothers bed and missed a tuck. The cloth was hanging and I didn’t catch it because I had to help my mother make dinner. I thought I had finished making the bed and ran downstairs to assist my mother. My brothers and father got in from their 13-hour workday and were, understandably, starving. The meal was glorious, steaming hot biscuits, potato’s mashed, ham slices and brownies—father always had to have his brownies after long days. My father and brothers drank and were singing songs at the table. My brothers were all underage, the oldest being 16, but father allowed them to drink because of their hard work. Father says if he had anyone else on the field working with him it would take him double the time and double the stress to get everything done. The boys were great workers, and my father made sure of it. The meal was finished with bellies protruding far past their normal girth. The boys went upstairs and my father sat in the living room with my mother listening to old Sinatra tunes on the radio. He loved singing along trying to emulate Sinatra’s voice, which he wasn’t very good at—nobody dared to tell him otherwise. I was cleaning up putting the dishes away when I heard my brother call down from the stairs. He told father that his bed wasn’t tucked like it usually is and that he didn’t work outside all day to come home to a messy house. Father looked at my mother with glaring eyes and asked her if she made his bed. My mother told him she didn’t, and looked in the kitchen at me with sorrow in her eyes. Knowing what she was condemning me to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Father got up, switched off the radio and came in the kitchen. His face was beat red and his eyes looked as though they were about to fall out of their sockets. A vein protruded in his neck and he stared through my soul with a malicious look. He asked if I had made that bed and I nodded silently, thinking about what my mother said to me if I messed something up. He took me by the back of the neck and forcibly walked me upstairs. I glanced at my mom as I past her but she had her head down in fear and shame, not wanting to look my father in the eyes. We arrived upstairs and he pushed me into my brother’s room. He closed the door and barked at my brother to show him the mistake. He pointed at the cloth sticking out and announced that he didn’t touch a thing. My father tossed me on the bed and unbuckled his belt. He called out every time he whooped my rear with the leather, making sure I knew what number he was on. He whipped me 20 times in total, my rear looked like a mixture of raspberries and grapefruits. My father unzipped his jeans, signaling my brother to do the same. Their pants dropped and they began their terror inside of me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won’t go into details; I will let your imagination explore what happened in that bedroom. However, I will tell you that it happened more and more frequently after that night. The seal had been broken, the gates of hell opened, and I was up for grabs after that. My brothers got more and more comfortable using my body without caring if I did anything wrong or not. My father turned a blind eye to it and my mother was too afraid for her life to intervene. Nobody dared talk back to my father or question his ways. He was the absolute king of the castle, ruler of the throne. Eventually I couldn’t feel anything anymore. I was hollow inside and the few days I wasn’t ravaged, I felt like I was missing something, like my day wasn’t complete. I sit here now knowing the extraordinary emotional and sexual abuse I suffered from my father and my brothers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On New Year’s my father invited other farmers and their families to our home to celebrate the new year. The wives and daughters were shackled to the kitchen, cooking until their fingers couldn’t grip a handle anymore. The men were all sitting at the table and we walked plate after plate out serving them like slaves treating their masters. The feast they had requested. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each man was allowed to request one item, and that item would be served without hesitation. Each person chipped in for the food, we couldn’t afford it all. The men were drinking heavily that night and they were all up late playing some sort of card game. The women were in the kitchen washing dishes and tidying up the area. The neighbor, Gene, that lived 3 miles away from us came into the kitchen and placed his hand around my hip. He yelled out to the living room that he “wanted this one”. My father stumbled into the kitchen and told Gene his dick had a craving for the young ones.  My father told him that he won the card game so he had the right to go first. Gene asked where he could throttle me and my dad pointed to the master bedroom. My mother began to cry outwardly and yelled for it to stop. My father sprung toward her and hit her across the face with his forearm. He was in shock she spoke up, and probably embarrassed his wife said anything to him. Gene smiled and dragged me to my father and mothers room and started in on me. Again, I won’t go into detail, I’m assuming you can guess how it went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gene finished up and walked out of the room, strapping his belt up and puffing his large belly out like he just finished a five course meal all by himself. He pointed to Charles, another neighbor, and said that he was in 2nd place, so it was his turn. He joked that my hole was a bit full but he was sure there was room for more. I was raped by 13 men that night. I was attended to by the local physician who looked at me and made sure I would live. He gave me some pain medication and told me the pain would pass with a few good night’s rest. He told me 13 year olds like me can take the pain because they’re ready to birth. The physician was the 6th person to rape me out of the 13. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Abigail Smith, and I stole your 8-year-old daughter. I was reading a book at the local coffee shop when I saw you two step in. The twinkle in your daughter’s eye reminded me of myself at that age. So carefree of the world, so blissful. You ordered the pumpkin spice flavored coffee and you ordered her a hot chocolate. You told her you would be right back while you went to the bathroom. You were so trusting of the sanctity Pionla, Iowa, blanketed you with. You were so daft. You should never leave a child alone no matter the age. You are never safe, not even on a farm in the middle of nowhere. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cynthia was coloring in bubble letters of her name, so it was very easy to get her attention. I turned to your little girl and said her name, pretending I didn’t see what she was doing. She asked me how I knew her name and I said I was a good friend of you, her mother. She asked what my name was and I told her it was Abigail. She pointed her eye browns down and told her that her mommy never had mentioned my name. I said that was because I had a big present waiting for her and it was in my car. Who likes to spoil a surprise? Her eyes lit up and a smile stretched across her pretty face. She asked if I had the present now or if she had to wait. I said I indeed have it now, it’s waiting for her in my car. She asked me if we could get it and I happily obliged. It was all quite easy, you really should have taught her smarter, I’m sure you never made her learn of the real monstrosities of the world. Shame on you, it should never be that easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nice thing about small towns are that shops can’t afford security cameras. They never think anything will go wrong to the magnitude of what happened. People try to abduct children all the time in big cities, and are usually caught. Silly them. We got to my car and your daughter asked me to pull it out. I told her to get in the back seat quickly because she had to sit down to open it. She looked a little worried, like she was thinking of you and what you would say to all this, but the carrot dangling in front of her face outweighed any fears she might have had. I opened the door and she hopped in. I got into the driver’s side and quickly applied the child locks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was screaming that she wanted her mommy in the car. I assured her she had her mommy, it was me. I was going to be her new mommy and she would have to come to accept it. Although, deep down, I knew none of it really would have mattered in the end. She stopped screaming about halfway to my home, which my ears were grateful for. I parked the car in the garage and opened her door, allowing her to walk freely inside her new home. She stayed in the car and started wailing more. I picked her up and carried her to my bedroom, where her chains were awaiting her flesh. I strapped her in and read stories to her. She seemed to like my Clifford books, he is a cute dog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She eventually fell asleep and I watched innocence emit from her body. She was so wholesome, so pure. I do want you to know I didn’t touch her sexually, I am not an animal like the farmers were to me. I wanted to protect her from that world. I needed to save her from a life of catcalling, sexual abuse and men thinking they can touch her wherever they please. Men disgust me and have no place in this world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As she was sleeping I knew I had to do it. I picked my pillow up and suffocated her with ease. Her legs were kicking up and down as if she was trying to run a race. Her little body gasping for air. I knew she was finally sleeping in Heaven when her legs were still and her body became stiff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kept her body around my house for a few weeks. I had her sit at the table with me as I ate and even read her more bedtime stories before I tucked her in at night in my bed. My body kept hers warm, but if I’m being honest, I enjoyed her cool touch against me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cynthia died and now you can rest without the pressures of men assaulting her on a daily basis and treating her less than. She will have lived a completely pure and innocent life, something most cannot account for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the box this note was stapled on is Cynthia’s body. You deserve to have the closure and burial. Cynthia was a sweet girl; she deserves the best stone you can afford. As her mother it is hard to give her up to someone else, but I know you are mourning her death, while I am celebrating her pure life. I will be joining Cynthia soon up in the gates of Heaven, where I can comfort and snuggle her until she falls back asleep among the clouds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To closure,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abigail Smith&lt;/p&gt;
